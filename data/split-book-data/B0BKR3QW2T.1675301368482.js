window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>No place like home</i></b><b>. Really, there isn't, is there?</b></p> <p>The Auction House is running well now with the help of Biggs, and the issues and other problems there are on the wane, which means it's now time to set about making Bartertown&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;as well. He's got a plan, he's got his sisters to help him, and he's also got his wives who are already starting to pull together as a family and figure out what their roles are going to be in helping him run all of this.</p> <p>Dr. Ruxton is still a bit of an enigma, but Mihalis is sure he'll figure it out, and honestly: he likes the guy. For a human he bears an incredible resemblance to the First at times: both ruthless&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;smart.</p> <p>Of course, there are still things he needs to deal with that are beyond the borders of his little domain, like his 'uncle' Steve's campaign for president. Some folks at House Uunregarten need to be taught a serious lesson, and there's an annoying elf who really needs to be removed from society.</p> <p><i>No Place Like Home</i> is not for shrieking violets or people who have issues with Sax and Violins (not that there are any 'wind' instruments, unless you consider those lovely female elven–and dark elven–voices!). Yes, there are some blue sections in this story, plus more than a few red ones, and even white! Hmm, where have I heard of&nbsp;<i>those</i>&nbsp;three colors before? Let me think...</p> <p>And last, but not least, we have a story that is NOT afraid to ask the question everyone is thinking of (but not answering yet): can Mihalis sing? And if he can, should he?</p>";
