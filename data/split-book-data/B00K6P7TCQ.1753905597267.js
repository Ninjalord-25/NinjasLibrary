window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here you have found a book so foul, so repulsive, so horrifying...that you will undoubtedly find yourself running to the nearest bathroom in an effort to both relieve your bowels and scrub your hands clean of their putrid filth. Though these attempts will be in vain - just as the authors of this demented book of short stories have planned. I speak of none other than the intolerable Mr. Vincent V. Cava and his dimwitted pen pal, S. R. Tooms (the pair oftentimes billed simply as hideous and handsome). They have finally released this humorous collection of terrifying tales, despite the bitter public outcry that demanded these pages never see the light of day...and perhaps for good reason.</p> <p> Inside this tome you will hear such stories as the much talked about \"Gas Station Bathroom\", which has been known to cause many travelers to rethink their next rest stop pullover.</p> <p> The psychological masterpiece in \"The Horror of Knowing\" will never allow you to gaze upon your friends in the same light again.</p> <p> \"A Favor for a Favor\" depicts an unparalleled moralistic look at the true nature of mankind - complete with an exquisitely satisfying finish that will have you shaking your head with sinister disbelief.</p> <p> These are but a few of the many finely crafted tales lurking within this haunted collection. To those of you with a few screws loose in the noggin or those with a twisted smile (and crooked tooth or two), I bid you enter this haven of horror....</p>";
