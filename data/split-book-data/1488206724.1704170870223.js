window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Oceans and decades apart, two women are inextricably bound by the secrets between them.</b></p> <p>Japan, 1957. Seventeen-year-old Naoko Nakamura’s prearranged marriage to the son of her father’s business associate would secure her family’s status in their traditional Japanese community, but Naoko has fallen for another man - an American sailor, a <i>gaijin - </i>and to marry him would bring great shame upon her entire family. When it’s learned Naoko carries the sailor’s child, she’s cast out in disgrace and forced to make unimaginable choices with consequences that will ripple across generations.</p> <p>America, present day. Tori Kovac, caring for her dying father, finds a letter containing a shocking revelation - one that calls into question everything she understood about him, her family and herself. Setting out to learn the truth behind the letter, Tori’s journey leads her halfway around the world to a remote seaside village in Japan, where she must confront the demons of the past to pave a way for redemption.</p> <p>In breathtaking prose and inspired by true stories from a devastating and little-known era in Japanese and American history, <i>The Woman in the White Kimono</i> illuminates a searing portrait of one woman torn between her culture and her heart, and another woman on a journey to discover the true meaning of home.</p>";
