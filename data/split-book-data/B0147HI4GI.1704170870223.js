window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first book in a new young adult line that asks listeners: What if classic Disney fairy tales had happened a little bit differently? </p> <p>When Jafar steals the genie's lamp, he uses his first two wishes to become sultan and the most powerful sorcerer in the world. Agrabah lives in fear, waiting for his third and final wish. To stop the power-mad ruler, Aladdin and the deposed Princess Jasmine must unite the people of Agrabah in rebellion. But soon their fight for freedom threatens to tear the kingdom apart in a costly civil war. </p> <p>What happens next? A \"street rat\" becomes a leader. A princess becomes a revolutionary. And listeners will never look at the story of Aladdin in the same way again.</p>";
