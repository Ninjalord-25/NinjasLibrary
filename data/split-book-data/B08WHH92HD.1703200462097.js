window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to Spellford Cove, where the baking is sweet and the witches are wild.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Robin Carter's life is less than stellar. All she has going for her are a minimum-wage job she hates, an uncanny ability to attract the biggest losers on her dating app, and a raccoon sitting in her kitchen sink eating her chips. So, when she finds out she's inherited a bakery in a small Washington town, Robin thinks this might just be the fresh start she desperately needs. Upon her arrival, however, Robin finds out she's inherited more than just a small business: she's also got her mother's magical powers.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, things start going south for Robin when a man dies at the local diner just after her arrival in town and she's fingered as the prime suspect. With half the town thinking she's a killer, Robin decides to take matters into her own hands. But between a ghost who desperately needs therapy, a snarky familiar who loves to quote literature, and a grandmother who walks to the beat of her own drum, Robin really has her hands full.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will she be able to navigate this new reality and find the killer, or will she crumble like an overcooked brownie?&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the first book in the Spellford Cove paranormal cozy mystery series.</p>";
