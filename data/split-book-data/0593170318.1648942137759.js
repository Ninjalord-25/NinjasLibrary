In chapters dense with 1980s iconography - from Heathers to \"big hair\" - Barry expertly weaves together the individual and collective progress of this enchanted team as they storm their way through an unforgettable season.</p> <p>Helmed by good-girl captain Abby Putnam (a descendant of the infamous Salem accuser Ann Putnam) and her co-captain Jen Fiorenza (whose bleached blonde \"Claw\" sees and knows all), the Falcons prove to be wily, original, and bold, flaunting society's stale notions of femininity in order to find their glorious true selves through the crucible of team sport and, more importantly, friendship.&nbsp;</p>";
