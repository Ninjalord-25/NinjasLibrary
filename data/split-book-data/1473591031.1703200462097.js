window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are dark forces at work in our world (and in Manchester in particular), so thank God <i>The Stranger Times</i> is on hand to report them.</p> <p>A weekly newspaper dedicated to the weird and the wonderful (but mostly the weird), it is the go-to publication for the unexplained and inexplicable.</p> <p>At least that's their pitch. The reality is rather less auspicious. Their editor is a drunken, foul-tempered and foul-mouthed husk of a man who thinks little of the publication he edits. His staff are a ragtag group of misfits. And as for the assistant editor...well, that job is a revolving door - and it has just revolved to reveal Hannah Willis, who's got problems of her own.</p> <p>When tragedy strikes in her first week on the job, <i>The Stranger Times</i> is forced to do some serious investigating. What they discover leads to a shocking realisation: some of the stories they'd previously dismissed as nonsense are in fact terrifyingly real. Soon they come face-to-face with darker forces than they could ever have imagined.</p> <p><i>The Stranger Times</i> is the first novel from C. K. McDonnell, the pen name of Caimh McDonnell. It combines his distinctive dark wit with his love of the weird and wonderful to deliver a joyous celebration of how truth really can be stranger than fiction.</p>";
