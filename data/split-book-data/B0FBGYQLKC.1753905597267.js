I promise.) <br> <br> They tried to kill him. They tried to destroy his marriage. They tried to take his friends, his company, and his title, but did they succeed?! Well, yes… yes they did, on all counts. But that doesn’t matter! For Jackson Blackwell, the one and only Shadow Master, took it all back. However, Sophia and her cabal of conspirators have gone too far this time. To defeat his enemies and save his daughter, Jackson and his loyal crew of misfits must venture into the dark, soulless depths of genre fiction’s red-headed stepchild: Young Adult Fantasy. <br> <br> Hidden deep within the Titan of Possibility exists Sablestone Academy for Villains, the multiverse’s premier educational institution in the nefarious arts. And it is here that the stakes have never been higher. The wager is simple: whoever has the best grades at the end of the school year may leave. The loser remains, trapped within Possibility for all time.</p> <p><i>Villains Academy</i> is the sixth installment in the award-winning Shadow Master series and where Jackson will have to put it all on the line. To save his daughter and survive the education system, Jackson must pit the culmination of his villainous experiences against wicked teens, secret plots, and a teaching staff packed with the most infamous (public domain) villains in all of literature! Does Jackson have what it takes to be the head of the class, or will he struggle to make the grade? (Yeah… these puns are terrible. But I swear the book is good!)</p>";
