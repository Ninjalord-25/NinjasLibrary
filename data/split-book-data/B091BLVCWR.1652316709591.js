window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is darkness falling upon the face of the earth?</p> <p>Ben, a 12-year-old orphan boy, must discover himself, what happened to his parents, his shamanic powers, and legacy. He might be the reincarnation of an ancient demigod, a wolf boy hero emerging from ancient Sumer (Sumeria). But this quest won't be easy because there will be dark forces, ghouls, necro creatures, curses, and much more against him.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this quest, joined by his friends, he will also be guided by visons of his father, a great shaman. And he will have to recover a sacred artifact called \"The Sphere of Truth and Wisdom\". This orb holds the wisdom and magic of all shamans past. This orb also holds the capacity to open a portal into the spiritual world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Benjamin Jones is an orphan boy who does not believe in his magic at first, but through patience and commitment to a cause bigger than himself, he will begin to explore the miracle of life. And that is exactly the hidden magic in each of our lives. This is the message of this story.</p>";
