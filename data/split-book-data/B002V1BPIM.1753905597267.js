window.bookSummaryJSON = "Like a car alarm, bagpipe music, or a doorbell ringing in the middle of the night, hearing this all-new audio edition of <i>The Bad Beginning</i> will only upset you. This unique multi-voice recording brings the first book in Lemony Snicket's alarming <i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i> to such terrible life that no one should really have to experience it. Unless you have an ear for such ghastly details as a tragic fire, a nefarious villain, itchy clothing, and cold porridge for breakfast, all narrated in chilly detail by the distinguished, and disturbed, Tim Curry with a team of talented readers, you would be better off listening to something else.";
