Novel*</b></p> <p><b>From the cocreator of </b><b><i>Deadpool</i></b><b> comes a highly entertaining debut featuring two unlikely and unforgettable amateur sleuths. An engrossing murder mystery full of skewering social commentary, </b><b><i>Suburban Dicks</i></b><b> examines the racial tensions exposed in a New Jersey suburb after the murder of a gas station attendant.</b></p> <p>Andie Stern thought she'd solved her final homicide. Once a budding FBI profiler, she gave up her career to raise her four (soon to be five) children in West Windsor, New Jersey. But one day, between soccer games, recitals, and trips to the local pool, a very pregnant Andie pulls into a gas station—and stumbles across a murder scene. An attendant has been killed, and the local cops are in over their heads. Suddenly, Andie is obsessed with the case, and back on the trail of a killer, this time with kids in tow.</p> <p>She soon crosses paths with disgraced local journalist Kenneth Lee, who also has everything to prove in solving the case. A string of unusual occurrences—and, eventually, body parts—surface around town, and Andie and Kenneth uncover simmering racial tensions and a decades-old conspiracy.</p> <p>Hilarious, insightful, and a killer whodunit, <i>Suburban Dicks </i>is the one-of-a-kind mystery that listeners will not be able to stop talking about.</p>";
