window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A headstrong princess finds herself entangled in intrigue, politics, magic, and love in this coming-of-age novel set in the world of the House Witch series.</b></p> <p>It’s been twenty years since Finlay Ashowan, the fabled house witch of Daxaria, first cooked up supernatural hijinks in the castle at Austice. Since then, much has changed: the royal family now resides elsewhere, a tentative peace has been established with Troivack, and the crown princess, Alina, is ready to pick the perfect nobleman to be her husband.</p> <p>But Alina’s quest for her ideal consort is proving rather difficult. For one, between her father’s nerves and her own health issues, relations within the family are tense at best. For another, Fin and his wife, Annika, have returned to the castle to celebrate Alina’s momentous choice, bringing with them their fiery daughter, Katarina; mysterious son, Tamlin; and mischievous familiar, Kraken—all of whom have a penchant for finding trouble that somehow surpasses that of the house witch himself. And finally, the most politically promising suitor, the king of Troivack, is nothing less than completely intolerable.</p> <p>Now, Alina must manage filial expectations, flirtatious miscues, magical misadventures, and dangerous plots, all as she struggles to find her own place within her kingdom—and understand the blossoming desires of her own heart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p>Featuring a new generation of delightful characters as well as the trademark charm, humor, and fantasy that made listeners fall in love with the House Witch series, <i>The Princess of Potential</i> is a captivating tale of courtly intrigue, slow-burn romance, and mystical adventure that’s perfect for teens and adults alike.</p> <p><b>The charming spin-off of the hit romantic-fantasy series that has more than a million views on Royal Road!</b></p>";
