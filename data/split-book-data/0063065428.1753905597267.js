Ten seemingly endless years of conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans are over. Troy has fallen. </p> <p>From the Trojan women whose fates now lie in the hands of the Greeks, to the Amazon princess who fought Achilles on their behalf, to Penelope awaiting the return of Odysseus, to the three goddesses whose feud started it all, these are the stories of the women whose lives, loves, and rivalries were forever altered by this long and tragic war. </p> <p>A woman’s epic, powerfully imbued with new life, <i>A Thousand Ships</i> puts the women, girls and goddesses at the center of the Western world’s great tale ever told.</p>";
