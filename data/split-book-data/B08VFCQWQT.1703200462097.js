window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When life goes sideways, embracing the adventure is the fastest way to set things right.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>One day I was just a widow facing the prospect of an empty nest, living a life that was anything but enchanted. The next, I had discovered my magical roots, and my rightful place as the Guardian of the portal between the Faery and Earth.&nbsp;</p> <p>There was shock. And there was fear. After all, no one plans to start over at 45. I intended to grow old with my husband. I thought we’d live an ordinary life. So I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste this opportunity to live in a world I always thought was imaginary.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m half-witch, half-faery, and facing dangers as real as the ache in my bad knee. Ibuprofen and caffeine keep me going, and I could do this for the rest of my life. Whoever thinks my family home is an easy mark better take notice: The new Guardian in town isn’t going down without a fight.&nbsp;</p> <p>After all, she’s already learned to let go of her simple existence and believe in the extraordinary power inside of her. What could possibly stop her now?&nbsp;</p>";
