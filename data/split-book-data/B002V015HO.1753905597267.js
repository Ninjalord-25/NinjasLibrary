His black humor, satiric voice, and incomparable imagination first captured America's attention in <i>The Sirens of Titan</i> in 1959 and established him as a \"true artist\" ( <i>The New York Times</i>) with <i>Cat's Cradle</i> in 1963. He is, as Graham Greene has declared, \"one of the best living American writers\". <p><i>Welcome to the Monkey House</i> is a collection of Kurt Vonnegut's shorter works. Originally printed in publications as diverse as <i>The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> and <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, what these superb stories share is Vonnegut's audacious sense of humor and extraordinary range of creative vision.</p>";
