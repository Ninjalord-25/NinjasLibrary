I actually used to be Charisma Silverstorm, member of one of the six elite Arcane Families, until my family shunned me when I turned 18 because my magic wasn't strong enough. However, where I lack in magic I more than make up for with the tech I develop, if I do say so myself. Apparently I'm not the only one.</p> <p>From the minute I received my diploma as a magical engineer, it seems like my world has turned upside down. Now, members of all six families are competing to get me to work for them. They're willing to use anything...from bribes to charm. It's not enough that the heirs to Arcane are walking sex gods, they also have a lot of money and exceptional magical skills.</p> <p>As our paths intertwine, I have to try to stay true to who I am, who I've always been, and not succumb to their charms. But how can a girl resist when the future she always dreamed of is right at her fingertips?</p> <p><i>This book is a reverse-harem romance intended for adult audiences. </i></p>";
