Or at least they used to be - until they were thrown out of the Duelist's Guild. </p> <p>As a last resort, they turn reluctant highwaymen. But when they pick the wrong carriage to rob, their simple plans to win back fame and fortune go south fast. </p> <p>After barely besting three armed men and a powerful magician, Vocho and Kacha make off with an immense locked chest. But the contents will bring them much more than they've bargained for when they find themselves embroiled in a dangerous plot to return an angry king to power.... </p> <p><b><i>Swords and Scoundrels</i> is the first book in The Duelist's Trilogy - a tale of death, magic, and family loyalty.</b> </p>";
