window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the bestselling author of <i>THE GREATCOATS</i> and <i>SPELLSLINGER</i>: seven war mages with dark pasts and special powers must come together to fight an unknown enemy—but the stakes are higher than anyone can imagine . . . and someone's setting them up for a fall.</p> <p><b>'Seven powerful mages want to make the world a better place. We're going to kill them first.'</b></p> <p>Picture a wizard. Go ahead, close your eyes. There he is, see? Skinny old guy with a long straggly beard. No doubt he's wearing iridescent silk robes that couldn't protect his frail body from a light breeze. The hat's a must, too, right? Big, floppy thing, covered in esoteric symbols that would instantly show every other mage where this one gets his magic? Wouldn't want a simple steel helmet or something that might, you know, protect the part of him most needed for conjuring magical forces from being bashed in with a mace (or pretty much any household object).<br> <br> Now open your eyes and let me show you what a <i>real</i> war mage looks like . . . but be warned: you're probably not going to like it, because we're violent, angry, dangerously broken people who sell our skills to the highest bidder and be damned to any moral or ethical considerations.<br> <br> At least, until such irritating concepts as <i>friendship </i>and <i>the end of the world</i> get in the way.<br> <br> My name is Cade Ombra, and though I currently make my living as a mercenary wonderist, I used to have a far more noble-sounding job title—until I discovered the people I worked for weren't quite as noble as I'd believed. Now I'm on the run and my only friend, a homicidal thunder mage, has invited me to join him on a suicide mission against the seven deadliest mages on the continent. <br> <br> Time to recruit some very bad people to help us on this job . . .</p>";
