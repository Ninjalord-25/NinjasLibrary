window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Evie Tanaka is the put-upon personal assistant to Aveda Jupiter, her childhood best friend and San Francisco’s most beloved superheroine. She’s great at her job - blending into the background, handling her boss’s epic diva tantrums, and getting demon blood out of leather pants.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, she’s not nearly as together when it comes to running her own life, standing up for herself, or raising her tempestuous teenage sister, Bea.&nbsp;</p> <p>But everything changes when Evie’s forced to pose as her glamorous boss for one night, and her darkest secret comes out: she has powers too. Now it’s up to her to contend with murderous cupcakes, nosy gossip bloggers, and supernatural karaoke battles - all while juggling unexpected romance and Aveda’s increasingly outrageous demands. And when a larger threat emerges, Evie must finally take charge and become a superheroine in her own right...or see her city fall to a full-on demonic invasion.</p>";
