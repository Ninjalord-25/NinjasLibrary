Going on the run to escape the associates of the villain he killed, he accompanies Aurora to Fiasco Heights, a sexy, dangerous city on a parallel world dominated by the good, the bad, and the pleasure-seeking.</p> <p>Once there, Quincy’s recruited into an underground team called “The Shadow Catchers”, a group of superheroes who’ve dedicated their lives to saving the city. Quincy soon discovers that he possesses superhuman abilities, which he’ll need as he battles supervillains, dragons, synthetic warriors, and the Harbinger, Fiasco Height’s most dangerous bad guy, who’s hell-bent on destroying the universe.</p> <p>Warning: This is a cinematic harem audiobook that shares much in common with a comic book or graphic novel. Do not buy this audiobook if you like the fade-to-black style or if the idea of listening to a thrilling story bulging with frenetic high-action, heroes, villains, hot superheroines, explosions, and a harem of lovely ladies turns you off. For everyone else - yes, this means you - what are you waiting for? Get the audiobook and enjoy!</p>";
