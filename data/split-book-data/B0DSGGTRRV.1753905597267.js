Next, there was a Dungeon Core without a name, a purpose, or any idea what was going on. Then, the one who calls himself Veos came to be . . .</p> <p>Veos has quickly proved to be far more capable than your average Dungeon Core. In the eyes of his challengers, at least. He's instinctive and motivated, with a drive to craft an intricate story and create obstacles for all those who seek to explore what lies beneath Nerian-Silex.</p> <p>Though Veos is certainly an unusual dungeon, what truly sets him apart is unknown to most—even himself. But now he's stumbled upon intel about the realm's dark history that, if tampered with, could reawaken a horrific enemy. And unbeknownst to him, he's attracted the attention of those who want that chapter to stay buried . . . as well as those who'd use the information to their own advantage.</p> <p>Who—or what—dares to delve deep enough to find out where this mysterious tale leads, and what will they have to face along the way?</p> <p><b>The hit LitRPG fantasy—with more than 300,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
