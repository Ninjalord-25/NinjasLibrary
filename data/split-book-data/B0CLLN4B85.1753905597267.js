In this mesmerizing tale about a Jazz Age gentlemanly thief, Jobb has found his own perfect jewel.”<br> ―DAVID GRANN, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Wager</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i></b></p> <p><b>“An enthrallingly propulsive, unpredictably twisty biography of one of the most fascinating criminals of the 20th Century. I was hooked from the very first heist.”<br> ―MICHAEL FINKEL, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Art Thief </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>The Stranger in the Woods</i></b></p> <p><i>Catch Me If You Can</i> meets <i>The Great Gatsby</i> meets the hit Netflix series <i>Lupin </i>in this captivating true-crime caper. A skilled con artist and perhaps one of the most charming, audacious burglars in history, Arthur Barry slipped in and out of the bedrooms of New York’s wealthiest residents, even as his victims slept only inches away. He befriended luminaries such as the Prince of Wales and Harry Houdini and became a folk hero, touted in the press as “the greatest jewel thief who ever lived” and an “Aristocrat of Crime.” In a span of seven years, Barry stole diamonds, pearls, and other gems worth almost $60 million today. Among his victims were a Rockefeller, an heiress to the Woolworth department store fortune, an oil magnate, Wall Street bigwigs, a top executive of automotive giant General Motors, and a famous polo player. Dean Jobb—hailed by <i>Esquire</i> magazine as “a master of narrative nonfiction”—once again delivers a stylishly told high-speed ride.</p> <p><i>A Gentleman and a Thief </i>is also a love story. Barry confessed to dozens of burglaries to protect his wife, Anna Blake (and was the prime suspect in scores of others). Sentenced to a twenty-five year term, he staged a dramatic prison break when Anna became seriously ill so they could be together for a few more years as fugitives. With dozens of historic images, A <i>Gentleman and a Thief </i>is page-turning, escapist, and sparkling with insight into our fascination with jewel heists and the suave, clever criminals who pull them off.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
