window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first Haunted Bookshop mystery from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Cleo Coyle, writing as Alice Kimberly</b></p> <p>Young widow Penelope Thornton-McClure and her old Aunt Sadie are making ends meet by managing a mystery book shop - a quaint Rhode Island landmark rumored to be haunted. Pen may not believe in ghosts, but she <i>does</i> believe in good publicity - like nabbing Timothy Brennan for a book signing. But soon after the bestselling thriller writer reveals a secret about the store's link to a 1940s murder, he keels over dead - and right in the middle of the store's new community events space.</p> <p>Who gives Mrs. McClure the first clue that it was murder? The bookstore's full-time ghost - a PI murdered on the very spot more than fifty years ago. Is he a figment of Pen's overactive imagination? Or is the oddly likable fedora-wearing specter the only hope Pen has to solve the crime? You can bet your everlasting life on it.</p>";
