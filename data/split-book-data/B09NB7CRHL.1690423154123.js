For Kira Kent, plant biologist, the System arrives while she's pulling an all-nighter at work with her pair of kids in tow.</p> <p>Now, instead of mundane parental concerns like childcare and paying the bills, she's got to figure out how to survive a world where already-deadly flora and fauna have grown even more perilous - all while dealing with the minutiae of the Systemâ€™s pesky blue screens and Levels and somehow putting together a community of survivors to forge a safe zone to shelter her son and daughter.</p> <p>It almost makes her miss the PTA fundraising sales.<i> Almost.</i></p> <p><i>Town Under</i> is the first book in a new series, The System Apocalypse: Australia. It's set in the same universe as Tao Wong's The System Apocalypse and starts in the same time period as <i>Life in the North</i>, but focuses on the changes on the deadliest of continents, Australia. Fans of the original series, LitRPG, fantasy, science fiction, and post-apocalyptic novels will want to take a look.</p> <p>Audio narration adjusted on 2022/01/29.&nbsp;</p>";
