For so long, these people looked up to the asuras as gods, but the asuras kept trying to kill them.</p> <p>Arthur Leywin has finally returned to the continent of Dicathen, but his home is still firmly in the hands of the enemy. His display of unprecedented power brings hope to his allies and fear to his enemies. It also deeply embroils him in a conflict between the godlike asuras, with Agrona Vritra on one side and Kezess Indrath on the other.</p> <p>With the crimes of his past life haunting him in the form of the Legacy, Arthur can no longer afford to hone only his strength. He must also empower those closest to him or risk losing them all.</p>";
