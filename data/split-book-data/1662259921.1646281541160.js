window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author Jeff Gunhus </b></p> <p><b>In the near future, the world order has deteriorated after America's exhaustion from endless foreign wars causes it to pull back within its borders. Its enemies and allies alike pursue their own interests, grabbing resources, erecting trade barriers, and launching opportunistic wars. The American Century is a distant memory.</b></p> <p>Sheriff Rick Johnson thinks he's left behind the problems of the greater world, retiring from the Marines to become the sheriff of the little town of Resurrection, Colorado. His relationship with Dahlia, his childhood friend's widow, has given him new purpose, along with the responsibility of being a father figure to her young son. Life isn't perfect, but it's better than he ever expected it would be after seeing the horrors of war. But when helicopters and armored vehicles filled with soldiers in hazmat suits unexpectedly quarantine the town, Sheriff Rick Johnson feels like the nightmares of the outside world have followed him home.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the town follows martial law, Rick isn't buying the official version of events from the military that a virus has been released into the air. As he investigates, the cover story unravels and he discovers the military's presence and the salvation they offer isn't what it seems. Soon he and his ex-flame, scientist Cassie Baker, are entangled in a plot so evil that it could only be borne from the absolute extremes of nationalism and madness.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are men in Resurrection who are willing to do anything to see America restored to its former greatness, even if the rest of the world must be destroyed to make it happen. But Rick Johnson is a man willing to do anything to protect the people he loves. And he's a force to be reckoned with.</p>";
