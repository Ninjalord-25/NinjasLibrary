window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In fierce, textured voices, the women of Ovid's </b><b><i>Metamorphoses </i></b><b>claim their stories and challenge the power of myth</b></p> <p><i>I am the home of this story. After thousands of years of other people’s tellings, of all these different bridges, of words gotten wrong, I’ll tell it myself.</i></p> <p>Seductresses and she-monsters, nymphs and demi-goddesses, populate the famous myths of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>. But what happens when the story of the chase comes in the voice of the woman fleeing her rape? When the beloved coolly returns the seducer's gaze? When tales of monstrous transfiguration are sung by those transformed? In voices both mythic and modern, <i>Wake, Siren </i>revisits each account of love, loss, rape, revenge, and change. It lays bare the violence that undergirds and lurks in the heart of Ovid’s narratives, stories that helped build and perpetuate the distorted portrayal of women across centuries of art and literature.</p> <p>Drawing on the rhythms of epic poetry and alt rock, of everyday speech and folk song, of fireside whisperings and therapy sessions, Nina MacLaughlin, the acclaimed author of <i>Hammer Head</i>, recovers what is lost when the stories of women are told and translated by men. She breathes new life into these fraught and well-loved myths.</p>";
