window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this unforgettable work of fiction, Donald Ray Pollock peers into the soul of a tough Midwestern American town to reveal the sad, stunted but resilient lives of its residents.</p> <p>Spanning a period from the mid-'60s to the late '90s, the linked stories that comprise <i>Knockemstiff </i>feature a cast of recurring characters who are woebegone, baffled, and depraved - but irresistibly, undeniably real. Rendered in the American vernacular with vivid imagery and a wry, dark sense of humor, these thwarted and sometimes violent lives jump off the page at the listener with inexorable force. </p> <p>A father pumps his son full of steroids, so he can vicariously relive his days as a perpetual runner-up body builder. A psychotic rural recluse comes upon two siblings committing incest and feels compelled to take action. Donald Ray Pollock presents his characters and the sordid goings-on with a stern intelligence, a bracing absence of value judgments, and a refreshingly dark sense of bottom-dog humor. </p> <p>With an artistic instinct honed on the works of Flannery O’Connor and Harry Crews, Pollock offers a powerful work of fiction in the classic American vein. <i>Knockemstiff</i> is a genuine entry into the literature of place.</p> <p>Audiobook Cast of Narrators:</p> <p>\"Real Life\" read by Kirby Heyborne</p> <p>\"Dynamite Hole\" read by Mark Bramhall</p> <p>\"Knockemstiff\" read by Macleod Andrews</p> <p>\"Hair’s Fate\" read by Andrew Eiden</p> <p>\"Pills\" read by Kirby Heyborne</p> <p>\"Gianthomachy\" read by David Garelick</p> <p>\"Schott’s Bridge\" read by Matt Godfrey</p> <p>\"Lard\" read by Macleod Andrews</p> <p>\"Fish Sticks\" read by Dan Woren</p> <p>\"Bactine\" read by Rob Shapiro</p> <p>\"Discipline\" read by R.C.
