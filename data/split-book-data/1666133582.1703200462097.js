He can't even use the cutting-edge hardware that would allow him to play in the full-immersion-games that have become so popular. This all changes when he hears from New Universal Frontiers, the company with the best game out there: World of Magic.</p> <p>They offer him the ability to use their hardware despite his injuries, but at a cost...he can never leave the game.</p> <p>Once in the game world, Lox quickly realizes that there is a lot more to this new realm than just a game. Given a class that everyone thinks is useless due its inherent dangers, Lox begins a long and painful series of trials, some of them explosive, almost all of them dangerous as he masters his magical abilities.</p> <p>As Lox explores the depths of this world's magic system, he soon discovers there is a lot more going on here than anyone ever expected.</p> <p><b>World of Magic is a LitRPG/GameLit series that features leveling, advanced magic systems, dungeon crawling, world exploration, and much more.
