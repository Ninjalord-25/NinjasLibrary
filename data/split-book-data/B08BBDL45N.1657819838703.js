window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Alexis Ravenel: Peasant. Princess. Pawn.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>As a peasant, I was forced to work the jewel mines in order to survive. My life was hard, but my worries were few: Affording food to eat, and keeping my pet sloth out of harm’s way. But when a chance encounter with a stranger concludes with me obtaining the power of the gods, suddenly my whole world changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When the Storm King finds out - and trust me, he always finds out - he plans to make me a princess by marrying me off to one of his four sons. Which doesn’t really seem like too bad of a thing...at first. After all, the Storm Princes are sexy as sin, rich, confident, and built like the very gods themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>But nothing is as simple as it seems, and the luxurious life of the Blackwood royals is nothing but a nightmare I cannot wake up from...and neither can the princes. They grew up knowing and resenting this fact, but I had to find out the hard way....&nbsp;</p> <p><b>In the Kingdom of Blackwood, we are all just pawns in the Storm King’s wicked game.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Taken by Storm</i> is the first book in the Storms of Blackwood series, a fast burn, RH, paranormal romance for 18 and up.</p>";
