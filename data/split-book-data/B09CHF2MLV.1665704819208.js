window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>OVERTAKEN ONLINE. The world's first FPS VR-MMORPG with 100% immersion. Reminiscent of classics like </b><b><i>Doom</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Dead Space</i></b><b>, but with RPG-elements that enable players to level up and develop skills and sprinkled with a pinch of magic.</b></p> <p>The 33-year old game designer Dex Walsh spends an entire year devoured by sorrow after the death of his wife. As a last-ditch effort to regain his joy, he sells everything and joins Overtaken Online. Expecting to spawn in a noob-friendly area with guidance from his personal assistant, he instead finds himself naked and alone in a dark prison cell rapidly filling with gas. Under-leveled and with no idea how to escape, he quickly learns no-one wants him alive in this godforsaken place.... Strap on your ammo belts, reload your weapons, and join this struggling Battle-Marine as he blasts through waves of demonic aliens while rescuing prisoners and increasing his power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beware! This GameLit / LitRPG / LitFPS story contains: - First person POV - Slow, steady progression / Non-OP MC - Stats / inventory management - Blood, guts, guns and F-bombs - No harem</p>";
