Like the footsteps outside her bedroom door late at night. Or the pounding on the walls. Maybe, even the reason why her sister is trying to ruin her life.</p> <p>Jocelyn finds a rational explanation for every strange incident until logic breaks down and sinister events ratchet up, convincing her that an evil entity has infested her home. With the help of a pair of paranormal investigators and a priest, Jocelyn hopes to defeat the malevolent entity before it destroys her family.</p> <p>But, what Jocelyn doesn't realize is that this demon has more nefarious plans than she could possibly imagine. And it's eager to set them in motion. </p> <p><b>Author's note: </b>All of my novels stand alone, but characters from one book often cross into the others, culminating in a climactic battle of good versus evil in the seventh book. Listeners will get extra satisfaction from reading phase one of my Haunted Universe - Sinister Spirits - in the sequential order.</p>";
