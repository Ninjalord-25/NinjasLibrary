window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first book in a wildly inventive and mesmerizing new fantasy series from acclaimed author Josiah Bancroft where magical mysteries abound and only one team can solve them: The Hexologists. “Bancroft is a magician.”—Madeline Miller, </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of </b><b><i>Circe</i></b></p> <p><b>“Fantastic! </b><b><i>The Hexologists</i></b><b> fizzes eloquently with wit and elegance, but also has marvelous worldbuilding and an excellent plot—and a central pair of characters who I quite simply love. A cocktail of a book made with the very best champagne.”—Genevieve Cogman, author of </b><b><i>The Invisible Library</i></b></p> <p>The Hexologists, Iz and Warren Wilby, are quite accustomed to helping desperate clients with the bugbears of city life. Aided by hexes and a bag of charmed relics, the Wilbies have recovered children abducted by chimney-wraiths, removed infestations of barb-nosed incubi, and ventured into the Gray Plains of the Unmade to soothe a troubled ghost. Well-acquainted with the weird, they never shy away from a challenging case.</p> <p>But when they are approached by the royal secretary and told the king pleads to be baked into a cake—going so far as to wedge himself inside a lit oven—the Wilbies soon find themselves embroiled in a mystery that could very well see the nation turned on its head. Their effort to expose a royal secret buried under forty years of lies brings them nose to nose with a violent anti-royalist gang, avaricious ghouls, alchemists who draw their power from a hell-like dimension, and a bookish dragon who only occasionally eats people.</p> <p>Armed with a love toughened by adversity and a stick of chalk that can conjure light from the darkness, hope from the hopeless, Iz and Warren Wilby are ready for a case that will test every spell, skill, and odd magical artifact in their considerable bag of tricks.</p> <p><b>\"Bancroft is a wonder as ever! </b><b><i>The Hexologists</i></b><b> was a joyous delight on every page— buoyantly inventive, witty, poignant, gripping, and deeply satisfying.\"—Madeline Miller, </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of </b><b><i>Circe</i></b></p> <p><b>“Josiah Bancroft’s imagination will astound you. One of the most inventive fantasy authors out there.”—Fonda Lee, author of the Green Bone Saga </b></p> <p><b>“Bancroft has returned to the page in force, deploying his crystal prose and razored wit around a tale that mixes whimsy and threat in equal measure. He's a gift to the genre</b><b><i>.\"</i></b><b>—Mark Lawrence, author of </b><b><i>The Book That Wouldn't Burn</i></b></p>";
