No punches pulled, no hilarities dodged, no meme unmangled! O <i>Bunny </i>you are sooo genius!\" (Margaret Atwood, via Twitter)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"A wild, audacious and ultimately unforgettable novel.\" (Michael Schaub,&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Awad is a stone-cold genius.\" (Ann Bauer,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Vegetarian </i>meets <i>Heathers </i>in this darkly funny, seductively strange novel from the acclaimed author of <i>13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl. </i></p> <p><i>\"We were just these innocent girls in the night trying to make something beautiful. We nearly died. We very nearly did, didn't we?\" </i></p> <p>Samantha Heather Mackey couldn't be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at New England's Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort - a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other \"Bunny\", and&nbsp;seem to move and speak as&nbsp;one.&nbsp;</p> <p>But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies' fabled \"Smut Salon\", and finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door - ditching her only friend, Ava, in the process. As Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the Bunnies'&nbsp;sinister yet saccharine world, beginning&nbsp;to take part in the ritualistic off-campus \"Workshop\" where they conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of reality begin to blur. Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly collision.&nbsp;</p> <p>The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the female experience, <i>Bunny </i>is a down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, friendship and desire, and the fantastic and terrible power of the imagination.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Named a Best Book of 2019 by </b><b><i>TIME</i></b><b>,&nbsp;</b><b><i>Vogue</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Electric Literature</i></b><b>, and The New York Public Library</b></p>";
