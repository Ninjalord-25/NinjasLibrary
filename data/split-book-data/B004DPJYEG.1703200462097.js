window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rick Yancey’s first gothic suspense tale, <i>The Monstrumologist</i>, earned him a prestigious Michael L. Printz Award. The second installment of this acclaimed series, <i>Curse of the Wendigo</i>, finds young Will Henry on the hunt for a supernatural beast plaguing New England in the late 1800s. Will and his mentor, the domineering Dr. Warthrop, are enlisted to help the doctor’s former fiancée. It seems her husband has been lost in the Canadian wilderness. And to make matters worse, there are reports that a Wendigo—a creature who gorges on human flesh—is on the loose.</p>";
