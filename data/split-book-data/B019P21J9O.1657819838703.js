window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Stephen King never stops giving us his all\" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) in this number-one national best seller about the idyllic small town of Haven, Maine, and its encounter with a deadly evil out for a diabolical invasion of body, soul - and mind. </p> <p>Writer Bobbi Anderson becomes obsessed with digging up something she's found buried in the woods near her home. With the help of her friend, Jim Gardener, she uncovers an alien spaceship. Though exposure to the Tommyknockers, who piloted the alien ship, has harmful effects on residents' health, the people of Haven develop a talent for creating innovative devices under their increasingly malignant influence. </p> <p>In this riveting, nightmarish story, Stephen King has given us a \"brilliant, riveting, marvelous\" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>) novel. \"You will not be able to put this down\" (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>). And the next time someone raps at your door, you may want to keep the chain on. It just might be the Tommyknocker Man. </p>";
