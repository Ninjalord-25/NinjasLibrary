window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dante Valentine’s working relationship with the Devil wasn’t her choice - but you don’t turn down a contract with Lucifer and live. Hired to kill fugitive Vardimal Santino, Dante can count as allies only a demon familiar she doesn’t trust and a small band of psychics. The thing is, Dante doesn’t need friends, she needs a miracle. Because the first time Dante Valentine met Santino, she almost died. </p>";
