Her relationships with superhero partner Aveda Jupiter, little sister Bea, and hot, half-demon husband Nate have never been stronger. Maybe it's possible for a grad-school dropout turned put-upon personal assistant turned superhero to have it all?&nbsp;</p> <p>Just when she thinks life can't get any better, Evie learns she's pregnant. Everyone around her is overjoyed...but Evie has major doubts about whether she's cut out for motherhood. Before she can dwell on her dilemma, a local women's college reports a string of mysterious hauntings, and Evie and Aveda are called in to investigate, going undercover as grad students during the creepiest time of the year: Halloween.&nbsp;</p> <p>As she confronts terrifying ghosts and lives out a bizarre version of the grad school life she left behind, Evie can't help but wonder about the road not taken: what would her life be like if she'd stayed here instead of pursuing superheroing with Aveda? And can an overwhelmed pregnant superhero truly have it all?She's about to find out.</p>";
