Keyne battles to be accepted for who he truly is - the king’s son. And Sinne dreams of seeing the world, of finding adventure.</p> <p>All three fear a life of confinement within the walls of the hold, their people’s last bastion of strength against the invading Saxons. However, change comes on the day ash falls from the sky. It brings with it Myrdhin, meddler and magician. And Tristan, a warrior whose secrets will tear them apart.</p> <p>Riva, Keyne, and Sinne - three siblings entangled in a web of treachery and heartbreak, who must fight to forge their own paths.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their story will shape the destiny of Britain.</p> <p><b>Inspired by the haunting folk ballad “The Twa Sisters”, set against the rich backdrop of ancient Britain, </b><b><i>Sistersong </i></b><b>is a dark and lyrical tale of siblings and sorcery from a spellbinding new voice.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Praise for <i>Sistersong</i></p> <p>\"​From its opening pages, <i>Sistersong</i> transports you to a time period often overlooked, and spins a tale of family, loyalty, and the triumph of becoming the person you were always meant to be.
