window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A paranormal women's fiction novel for anyone who thought adventure and magic stopped at 40. Guess again, it's just the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p>I never expected I'd be one of those people who had a midlife crisis. Sure, I'm over 40 and married, but my kids are grown and moved out. Life is steady, if predictably boring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>That all changes when my husband asks for a divorce and my whole world crashes. Everything I thought I knew, everything I am, gone in an instant. But I am not about to give up. After all, at my age, technically, I'm only halfway there.&nbsp;</p> <p>I am ready to tackle my do-over; my chance to become the me I've always dreamed of. Starting with moving into my late grandma's cottage and adopting a new kitten.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, my new life is a little odder than expected. Old books suddenly appearing in my house. Neighbors going missing. A supposed lake monster and a strange man who likes to skulk around with an axe.&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm going to need to lean on my friends, new and old, to help me navigate my midlife crisis. Together maybe we will find a way to beat the family curse ruining my second chance at life.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
