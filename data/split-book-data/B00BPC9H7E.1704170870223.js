window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The doughnut is a thing of beauty. <br>A circle of fried doughy perfection. <br>A source of comfort in trying times, perhaps. <br>For Theo Bernstein, however, it is far, far more. </b></p> <p>Things have been going pretty badly for Theo Bernstein. An unfortunate accident at work has lost him his job (and his work involved a Very Very Large Hadron Collider, so he's unlikely to get it back). His wife has left him. And he doesn't have any money. </p> <p>Before Theo has time to fully appreciate the pointlessness of his own miserable existence, news arrives that his good friend Professor Pieter van Goyen, renowned physicist and Nobel laureate, has died. </p> <p>By leaving the apparently worthless contents of his safety deposit box to Theo, however, the professor has set him on a quest of epic proportions. A journey that will rewrite the laws of physics. A battle to save humanity itself. </p> <p>This is the tale of a man who had nothing and gave it all up to find his destiny - and a doughnut.</p>";
