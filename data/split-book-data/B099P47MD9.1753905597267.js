Everyday places and situations are the backdrops for tense and unpredictable confrontations. A chance encounter between neighbors in their building’s trash room; a routine visit to a yoga class; a friendly chat in the cardiac recovery ward of a hospital - 13 commonplace moments escalate into tension, violence - and even death. Patterned after such classic suspense radio programs as <i>Inner Sanctum</i> and <i>The Shadow</i>, every tale from <i>The Creepery</i> promises to wrack your nerves to the breaking point. </p> <p>“You Have a Guest” </p> <p>It isn’t a sin to fantasize about your wife’s sister...or is it? </p> <p>“Get Well Soon” </p> <p>A hospital cardiac ward is the last place you would expect to hear a political quarrel.

Or was it Robert Tandry’s descent into the jaws of Hell? </p> <p>“Rogue Restroom” </p> <p>Boy meets girl in the unlikeliest place - a unisex bathroom, where nothing functions the way it’s supposed to. </p> <p>“Driven” </p> <p>A drive to the country club in a luxurious limo takes a sharp turn into the terrifying unknown. </p> <p>“Have a Nice Transaction” </p> <p>When Stuart encounters a vagrant at the bank, he hears a hard luck story.

At last, they came to the planet Earth, but alas...they found none there, either. </p> <p>“The Man in the Shuffle” </p> <p>Ralph Miller will do anything to get rid of the voices in his head - anything. Anything! </p> <p>“Godhead” </p> <p>Godhead is the title of a favorite painting that Madeline, the artist, sold in a moment of weakness.
