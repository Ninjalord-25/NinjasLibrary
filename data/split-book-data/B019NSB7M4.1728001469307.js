window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>London, April 1812. Eighteen-year-old Lady Helen Wrexhall is on the eve of her debut presentation to the Queen. Her life should be about gowns and dancing, and securing a suitable marriage. Instead, when one of her family's housemaids goes missing, Lady Helen is drawn to the shadows of Regency London. </p> <p>There, she finds William, the Earl of Carlston. He has noticed the disappearance, too, and is one of the few who can stop the perpetrators: a cabal of powerful demons that has infiltrated every level of society. But Lady Helen's curiosity is the last thing Carlston wants - especially when he sees the searching intelligence behind her fluttering fan. Should Helen trust a man whose reputation is almost as black as his lingering eyes? And will her headstrong sense of justice lead them both into a death trap? </p> <p>In <i>The Dark Days Club</i>, internationally best-selling author Alison Goodman introduces listeners to a heroine who is just as remarkable as Eona - and yet again reinvents an established literary genre, making it her own. </p>";
