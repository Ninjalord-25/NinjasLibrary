Sure. </p> <p>Find out who killed Lance Niles, the big-shot businessman who just arrived in town? I'll give it shot. </p> <p>Help an old-lady Elf track down her husband's murderer? That's right up my alley. </p> <p>What I don't do, because it's impossible, is search for a way to bring the goddamn magic back. </p> <p>Rumors got out about what happened with the Professor, so now people keep asking me to fix the world. </p> <p>But there's no magic in this story. Just dead friends, twisted miracles, and a secret machine made to deliver a single shot of murder. </p> <p><b>Welcome back to the streets of Sunder City, a darkly imagined world perfect for listeners of Ben Aaronovitch and Jim Butcher.</b></p>";
