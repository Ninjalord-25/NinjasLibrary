Welcome to my reality.</b></p> <p>When the cultivators came to Earth,<b> </b>they destroyed our entire civilization in a matter of hours. Armies fell, cities burned, and that was before the moon turned red and filled our world with monsters.</p> <p>Now, over a decade later, what's left of humanity slaves under the heels of our Qi-infused masters. The luckiest of us might even become one of them, they sayâ€”if we serve the Dynasty well enough and harness the power of Qi.</p> <p>But I want none of that.</p> <p>I'm sick of serving, and I want nothing to do with their world. Instead, I want them to pay for what they did to mine. Maybe that's why she found me: the fearsome, angry goddess who showed me a different path. Apparently, Qi is not the only route to power.</p> <p>Now I'll fight to take back my planet, to grow strong enough to beat the cultivators at their own game. Through the power of blood, rage, and pain, I will free humanity or die trying.</p> <p>For that's the Path of a Berserker.</p> <p><i>Path of the Berserker</i> is a progression fantasy novel that contains immortal cultivators, an oppressive intergalactic dynasty, rage-inducing imperial bureaucracy, magical spirit beasts, fantastical martial arts, and one pissed-off MC who's sick of it all. Fans of Western-style cultivation fantasy, post-apocalypse, and xianxia should enjoy.</p>";
