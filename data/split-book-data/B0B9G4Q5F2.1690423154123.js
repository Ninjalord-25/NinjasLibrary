I’m Shady Greg, and I’ve got a plan.</p> <p>Jadera—the land that stole me from Earth and assigned me to be a Merchant—is opening a new area soon, and I’m going to be the first to plunder its riches! Ahem, I mean, set up shops that help adventurers like you. At reasonable prices, even!</p> <p>It's ripe for the taking! I've never seen an opportunity this good. With the dastardly villain of my last adventure out of the picture, there’s really nothing between me and a monopoly of the new Misty Isles!</p> <p>Nothing could possibly go wrong! Even The Profit thinks it’s a good idea!</p> <p>(Oh shush, you. I hear you laughing. I’m trying to keep this optimistic!)</p>";
