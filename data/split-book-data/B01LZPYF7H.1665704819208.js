window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rachel Griffin wants to know everything. As a freshman at Roanoke Academy for the Sorcerous Arts, she has been granted to opportunity to study both mundane and magical subjects. </p> <p>But even her perfect recollection of every book she has ever read does not help her when she finds a strange statue in the forest - a statue of a woman with wings. Nowhere - neither in the arcane tomes of the Wise, nor in the dictionary and encyclopedia of the non-magic-using Unwary - can she find mention of such a creature. </p> <p>What could it be? And why are the statue's wings missing when she returns? </p> <p>When someone tries to kill a fellow student, Rachel soon realizes that, in the same way her World of the Wise hides from mundane folk, there is another, more secret world hiding from everyone - which her perfect recall allows her to remember. Her need to know everything drives her to investigate. </p> <p>Rushing forward where others fear to tread, Rachel finds herself beset by wraiths, magical pranks, homework, a Raven said to bring the doom of worlds, love's first blush, and at least one fire-breathing teacher. </p> <p>Curiosity might kill a cat, but nothing stops Rachel Griffin! </p>";
