window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>The much-beloved BookTok sensation, Travis Baldree's novel of high fantasy and low stakes.</b></p> <p><b>Come take a load off at Viv's cafe, the first and only coffee shop in Thune. Grand opening! </b></p> <p>Worn out after decades of packing steel and raising hell, Viv, the orc barbarian, cashes out of the warrior’s life with one final score. A forgotten legend, a fabled artifact, and an unreasonable amount of hope lead her to the streets of Thune, where she plans to open the first coffee shop the city has ever seen.</p> <p>However, her dreams of a fresh start filling mugs instead of swinging swords are hardly a sure bet. Old frenemies and Thune’s shady underbelly may just upset her plans. To finally build something that will last, Viv will need some new partners, and a different kind of resolve.</p> <p><b>A hot cup of fantasy, slice-of-life with a dollop of romantic froth.</b></p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books.</b></p>";
