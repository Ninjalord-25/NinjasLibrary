And in Manningtree, a town depleted of men since the wars began, the hot terror of damnation burns in the hearts of women left to their own devices.</b></p> <p>Rebecca West, fatherless and husbandless, chafes against the drudgery of her days, livened only occasionally by her infatuation with handsome young clerk John Edes. But then a newcomer, who identifies himself as the Witchfinder General, arrives. A mysterious, pious figure dressed from head to toe in black, Matthew Hopkins takes over the Thorn Inn and begins to ask questions about what the women on the margins of this diminished community are up to. Dangerous rumors of covens, pacts, and bodily wants have begun to hang over women like Rebeccaâ€”and the future is as frightening as it is thrilling.</p> <p>Brimming with contemporary energy and resonance, <i>The Manningtree Witches</i> plunges its listeners into the fever and menace of the English witch trials, where suspicion, mistrust, and betrayal run amok as a nation's arrogant male institutions start to realize that the very people they've suppressed for so long may be about to rise up and claim their freedom.</p>";
