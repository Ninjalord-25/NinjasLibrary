window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER</b></p> <p>In the late summer of a long-ago year, Alton Turner Blackwood brutally murdered four families. His savage spree ended only when he himself was killed by the last survivor of the last family, a fourteen-year-old boy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Half a continent away and two decades later, someone is murdering families again, re-creating in detail Blackwoodâ€™s crimes. Homicide detective John Calvino is certain that his own family - his wife and three children - will be targets, just as his parents and sisters were victims on that distant night when he was fourteen and killed their slayer.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a detective, John is a man of reason who deals in cold facts. But an extraordinary experience convinces him that sometimes death is not a one-way journey, that sometimes the dead return.&nbsp;</p>";
