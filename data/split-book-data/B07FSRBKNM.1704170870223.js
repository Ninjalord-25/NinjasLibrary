Listen along as Tanis Parenteau's impeccable narration, capturing the rhythms of Navajo speech, fully envelopes you into the Sixth World.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Dinétah needs help finding a missing girl, Maggie - a monster hunter and supernatural killer - is its last, best hope. <i>Trail of Lightning </i>follows our heroine as she walks the land alongside gods, heroes of legend, and monsters alike. Reluctantly, she enlists the aid of an unconventional medicine man, and together they travel Dinétah, unraveling clues from ancient legends and trading favors with tricksters. As Maggie discovers the truth behind the killings, she will have to confront her past if she wants to survive - for what she uncovers about the monster she is sent to find is much more terrifying than anything she could imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
