With Lou’s way of life fast vanishing, an ex-dispatcher returns to town on the lam, triggering a bedlam shift that will test Lou’s sanity and perhaps cost him his life. Against this backdrop, Lou has to keep driving and driving - even if that means aiding and abetting the host of criminal misfits haunting the back seat of his Town Car. </p> <p>Written by a former cabbie, <i>The Last Taxi Driver</i> careens through the highways and backroads of North Mississippi as Lou becomes increasingly somnambulant and his fares increasingly eccentric.</p>";
