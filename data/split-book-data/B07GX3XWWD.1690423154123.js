Salem’s mission is simple: find the Tears of God in seven days, or else his land, and the people residing there, will either be sold to a demonic lord or face death. The only things in his way are demonic Abominations, shape-shifting bison, murderous men, and the last remnant of an angelic choir. Salem pits everything he has, and everything he is, to hold on to hope and save his people.</p> <p>No pressure.&nbsp;</p> <p>While Salem risks his life, Vali and Father Grimm risk theirs, too.
