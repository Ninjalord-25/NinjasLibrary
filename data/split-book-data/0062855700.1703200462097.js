window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This thrilling YA retelling of Kurosawa’s </b><b><i>Seven Samurai</i></b><b> features a girl tasked with saving the world from eternal darkness. Perfect for fans of </b><b><i>Six of Crows</i></b><b> and Marie Lu. </b></p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Kira Fujikawa has never had it easy. She’s bullied by the popular girls in school. Her parents ignore her. And she’s also plagued with a secret: She can see yokai, the ghosts and demons that haunt the streets of Kyoto.&nbsp;</p> <p>But things accelerate from bad to worse when she learns that Shuten-doji, the demon king, will rise at the next blood moon to hunt down an ancient relic and bring the world to a catastrophic end. Not exactly skilled at fighting anything, much less the dead, Kira enlists the aid of seven powerful death gods to help her slay Shuten-doji. They include Shiro, a kitsune with boy-band looks who is more flirtatious than helpful, and O-bei, a regal demon courtier with reasons of her own for getting involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the confrontation with Shuten-doji draws nearer, the fate of Japan hangs in the balance. Can Kira save humankind? Or will the demon king succeed in bringing eternal darkness upon the world?&nbsp;</p>";
