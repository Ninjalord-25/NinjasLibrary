window.bookSummaryJSON = "The demon, known only as \"Jakerbok\", is a major force of evil then and now. He taunts the listener to \"Burn this audiobook\" throughout this satanically autobiographical monologue, for he has embedded his very self inside each word....as a long-dormant vehicle for the dark forces to finally conquer all things good and holy in this world. <p>A one-man (or, rather a one-demon) narrative, in which this medieval devil speaks directly to the listener, is sure to become an instant classic for all fans of major \"good vs. evil\" literary works. This is the first known time that the voice of a major demon has ever been realized in audiobook form, in which it speaks directly, as in a poker game, to the listener.</p> <p>Featuring shockingly crafted dialogue and details of the epic hell that the \"author\" can - and promised to - unleash if this work is circulated, the storyline of this short fiction has Jakerbok explaining his \"roots\" in this world to the listener. He goes back centuries, to his childhood traumas at the hands of his own parents, who are themselves super demons.</p> <p> The story then tells the saga of how Jakerbok rose from being a \"minor\" demon to a \"major\" demon. It culminates with his insidious plot to \"invade\" the minds and hearts of all humankind everywhere via this very book, which contains the ancient demon's actual power deep within every word.</p>";
