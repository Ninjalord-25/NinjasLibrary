Or so I thought.</p> <p>For years, I believed my destiny was beyond my control. But the Fates love to play with folks, and I seem to be their favorite punchline.</p> <p>Just when my crew and I thought we were done with the apocalypse, the Fates dragged back for another round. Now, we have to stop the powers-that-be and my future son or the ones I love and cherish will become memories.</p> <p>It's a demon-eat-demon world, and we are all the stands between humanity and total subjugation.</p> <p>Includes bonus Chronicles of Nick: Shadows of Fire novella, <i>Last Christmas.</i></p>";
