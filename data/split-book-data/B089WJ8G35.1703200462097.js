window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>“We can’t waltz forever, Grant.” </i><br> <i>“We can damn well try.”</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Magical musician Murder LaVoe is tired of running. She’s been running for nearly 500 years. When you don’t age, people take it personally. She has returned 40 years later to her favorite borough in New York City, hoping to finally settle down and hide her secret by taking the identities of falsified heirs. A public attempt on the life of her rock 'n' roll alter ego, Lady Dreamscapes, and a chance meeting of subservient immortals in need, threaten to take away the life she holds so dear. Can NYPD detective Grant Noble III solve her mysteries in time to save her? Maybe it’s him that needs saving?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Levi Esmund is a Protector of the Ageless sculpted from Clay by Murder’s mother to be her companion. No one knows just how tied the fates of the Protectors are to their charges. Levi just wants a good book, and a hot guy. Maybe, just maybe, he’d like to be a real boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Tress is also a Protector. A trans-woman, and white-out Victorian goth, who has learned to excel at glamours and wards. The Curse of the Ageless prevents her from physically becoming a woman permanently. She’s devoted her life to helping trans-girls in need. Just one problem. She has yet to figure out how to save herself.</p> <p>Series overview:</p> <p>We have existed in the shadows of your world for all of history. <br> The blessed, the cursed, the mages, and the witches. <br> Sometimes you choose to ignore us. <br> Sometimes we cover it up. <br> We keep our heads down, lest you lot make them roll.&nbsp;</p>";
