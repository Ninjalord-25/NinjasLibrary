window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Go West, Prof. Croft!</b></p> <p>When my magical order assigns me to Grimstone, Colorado, on a case, I’m in no hurry to pack my staff and spell books. The outlaw county is a far cry from my academic calling in New York City. And I’m being paired with junior wizard James Wesson. A brash hustler and wannabe cowboy, he’s exactly why I prefer working alone.</p> <p>But something sinister is snatching women on the full moon. The local werewolf gang? The 600-pound witch who runs the brothel? Or does the perp come from the mortal ranks of a population as strange as any supernatural I’ve encountered?</p> <p>The only certainty is the lunar cycle, set to wax full in 24 hours - meaning we need to get cracking.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can the wizard duo of Croft and Wesson blow open the case in time to save the next victim?&nbsp;Or will our odd-couple act spell doom for Grimstone?</p> <p><b>Croft &amp; Wesson is a spinoff of the popular Prof Croft series but stands on its own. If you like buddy wizards, occult mysteries, and wild spell-slinging in one of the Wilder Wests around, you’ll love Croft &amp; Wesson!</b></p>";
