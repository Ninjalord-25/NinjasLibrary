window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>National best seller</b></p> <p><b>A supernatural force - set in motion a century ago - threatens to devastate New York City in this “terrific horror/suspense/disaster novel” that “grips from the first page” (Stephen King, number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author).</b></p> <p>Far upstate, in New York’s ancient forests, a drowned village lays beneath the dark, still waters of the Chilewaukee reservoir. Early in the 20th century, the town was destroyed for the greater good: Bringing water to the millions living downstate. Or at least that’s what the politicians from Manhattan insisted at the time. The local families, settled there since America’s founding, were forced from their land, but some didn't leave....</p> <p>Now, a century later, the repercussions of human arrogance are finally making themselves known. An inspector assigned to oversee the dam, dangerously neglected for decades, witnesses something inexplicable. It turns out that more than the village was left behind in the waters of the Chill when it was abandoned. A dark prophecy remained, too, and the time has come for it to be fulfilled - for sacrifices must be made. And as the dark waters begin to inexorably rise, the demand for a fresh sacrifice emerges from the deep....&nbsp;</p> <p>“A must read for fans of eerie, gripping storytelling” (Dean Koontz, number one <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author), <i>The Chill</i> is “a creepy tale of supernatural terror” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review).&nbsp;</p>";
