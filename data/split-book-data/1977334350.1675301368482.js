window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>USA Today</i> and number-one Amazon best-selling author Jeremy Bates comes a tale of mystery and horror set in Japan's ancient Suicide Forest, a place that is easy to enter but, for some, impossible to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Just outside of Tokyo lies Aokigahara, a vast forest and one of the most beautiful wilderness areas in Japan...and also the most infamous spot to commit suicide in the world. Legend has it that the spirits of those many suicides are still roaming, haunting deep in the ancient woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When bad weather prevents a group of friends from climbing neighboring Mt. Fuji, they decide to spend the night camping in Aokigahara. But they get more than they bargained for when one of them is found hanged in the morning - and they realize there might be some truth to the legends after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
