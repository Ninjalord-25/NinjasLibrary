window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A thrilling tale of high-altitude death and survival set on the snowy summits of Mount Everest, from the best-selling author of <i>The Terror</i>. </p> <p>The year is 1924 and the race to summit the world's highest mountain has been brought to a terrified pause by the shocking disappearance of George Mallory and Sandy Irvine, high on the shoulder of Mt. Everest. By the following year, three climbers - a British poet and veteran of the Great War, a young French Chamonix guide, and an idealistic young American - find a way to take their shot at the top. They arrange funding from the grieving Lady Bromley, whose son also disappeared on Mt. Everest in 1924. Young Bromley <i>must </i> be dead, but his mother refuses to believe it and pays the trio to bring him home. </p> <p>Deep in Tibet and high on Everest, the three climbers - joined by the missing boy's female cousin - find themselves being pursued through the night by someoneâ€¦or something. This nightmare becomes a matter of life and death at 28,000 feet - but what is pursuing them? And what is the truth behind the 1924 disappearances on Everest? As they fight their way to the top of the world, the friends uncover a secret far more abominable than any mythical creature could ever be. A pulse-pounding story of adventure and suspense, <i>The Abominable </i> is Dan Simmons at his spine-chilling best. </p>";
