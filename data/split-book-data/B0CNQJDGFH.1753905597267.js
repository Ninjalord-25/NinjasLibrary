A touch cozy fantasy and a touch horror, </b><b><i>The Dollmakers</i></b><b> is perfect for fans of Studio Ghibli films, the works of TJ Klune and Travis Baldree, and listeners of </b><b><i>Juniper &amp; Thorn</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Goblin Emperor</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>In the country called One, dollmakers are vital members of the community. An artisan’s doll is the height of society’s accomplishments, while a guard’s doll is the only thing standing between the people of One and the Shod: vicious, cobbled monstrosities that will tear apart any structure—living or dead, inanimate or otherwise—to add to their horde.</p> <p>Apprentice Shean of Pearl is a brilliant dollmaker. With her clever dolls, she intends to outsmart and destroy the Shod, once and for all—a destiny she’s worked her whole life toward accomplishing. But when the time comes for her dolls to be licensed, she’s told her work is too beautiful and delicate to fight. A statement that wounds and infuriates her; the Shod killed everyone she loved. How could her fate be anything <i>but</i> fighting them?</p> <p>In an attempt to help her see a new path for herself, Shean’s mentor sends her on a journey to the remote village called Web, urging her to glean some wisdom from Ikiisa, a reclusive and well-respected guard dollmaker. But Shean has another plan: if she can convince the village of Web of her talents, the Licensor Guild will <i>have</i> to reconsider and grant her a guard’s license. And what better way to convince them than challenging Ikiisa and instating herself as the official dollmaker of Web? Once she’s done that, proving her dolls’ worth in the fight against the Shod will be simple.</p> <p>As simple, that is, as calling the Shod to Web...</p>";
