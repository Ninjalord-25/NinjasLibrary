His mother died giving birth to him and his father never let him forget it; until the night he was butchered by a werewolf - the night a full moon ruined his life. </p> <p>Alone in the world, Sylvester is taken in by Michael Winterfox, a Cheyenne mystic. Winterfox, once a werewolf hunter, trains the boy to be a warrior - teaching him how to block out pain, stalk, fight, and kill. Bit by bit, all that makes Sylvester human is sacrificed to the hunt. Now, Sylvester's hatred has become a monster all its own, robbing him of conscience and conviction as surely as the Beast's bite. </p> <p>As he follows his vendetta into the outlands of the occult, options become scarce. And he learns it takes more than silver bullets to kill a werewolf... To kill a werewolf, it takes a hunter with a perfect willingness to die. </p>";
