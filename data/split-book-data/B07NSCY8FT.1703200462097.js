window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A giant redneck in Fairyland, what could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Everything. Absolutely everything.</p> <p><i>Monsters, Magic, &amp; Mayhem</i> collects four novellas chronicling Bubba the Monster Hunter's trip through the lands of the Fae in search of his kidnapped sister. Yeah, he didn't know he had a sister, either. And that joke's old, man.</p> <p><i>Into the Mystic</i> - Bubba and his troupe of merry morons has to find their way to Fairyland to rescue his sister. It's not as easy as it sounds, and it involves Bubba learning a lot of uncomfortable truths about why his mother walked out and his maybe not-quite human heritage.</p> <p><i>Cold as Ice</i> - Bubba meets his grandmother, which should be great. Except she's the psychotic Queen of the Winter Court and wants to pretty much murder everyone. There's torture, tights, and Bubba dancing. Which is pretty much torture in tights. So lots of torture.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Hot Blooded</i> - Bubba and co. travel to the Summer Court in their quest for his sister, only to find that his grandfather, while less abjectly psychopathic than his ex-wife, Mab, is still kind of a douche. And just when the team thought they were on the right track to finish their quest, there's a dragon. A dragon. This is not something growing up in Georgia prepares you for.</p> <p><i>Shades of Grey</i> - Bubba is closing in on his sister and her kidnapper, the Shakespearean trickster Puck. Except, he's not like hot Loki trickster. He's more like cut-your-throat-while-you-sleep-and-tell-you-a-knock-knock-joke-while-you're-bleeding-out trickster. Bubba has to battle his way through a horde of zombies just to get the opportunity to go on an old-fashioned dungeon crawl (with spiders, because...dungeon) to maybe finally confront Puck and save his sister.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then they get home, and things get <i>really </i>screwed up!</p>";
