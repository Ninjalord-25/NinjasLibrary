window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jonathan Maberry, the first in a thrilling series of novels based on <i>Deadlands</i>, a hugely successful role-playing game (RPG) set in the Weird, Weird West. </p> <p>Welcome to the Deadlands, where steely eyed gunfighters rub shoulders with mad scientists and dark, unnatural forces. Where the Great Quake of 1868 has shattered California into a labyrinth of sea-flooded caverns...and a mysterious substance called \"ghost rock\" fuels exotic steampunk inventions as well as plenty of bloodshed and flying bullets. In <i>Ghostwalkers</i>, a gun for hire, literally haunted by his bloody past, comes to the struggling town of Paradise Falls, where he becomes embroiled in a deadly conflict between the besieged community and a diabolically brilliant alchemist who is building terrible new weapons of mass destruction...and an army of the living dead! <i>Deadlands</i> is one of the most popular RPGs in history, with over a million <i>Deadlands</i> gaming books sold. </p>";
