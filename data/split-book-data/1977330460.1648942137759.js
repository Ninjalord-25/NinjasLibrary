window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When I first landed a bartending job at the local guild, I didn't know a thing about magic. These days, I'm practically an expert on the different magical classes, but there's one nobody ever talks about: Demonica.&nbsp;</p> <p>Turns out they have a good reason for that. My guild is strictly hellion-free, because who wants to risk life and limb to control the biggest bullies on the mythic playground?&nbsp;</p> <p>Well, some people do, and now a demon has been loosed in the city. My three best friends are determined to slay it, but even badass combat mages are critically out-magicked. And that's not all. The monster they're tracking-it's not hiding. It's not fleeing. It's not leaving a trail of corpses everywhere it goes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The demon is hunting too. And in a city full of mythics, it's searching for deadlier prey.&nbsp;</p> <p>If we can't unravel the demon's sinister motivations, more innocent people will die, but finding the answers means digging into dark secrets...and learning truths I never wanted to know.</p> <p>Make sure to check out the companion series, The Guild Codex: Demonized, available now, and The Guild Codex: Warped, coauthored by Rob Jacobsen.</p>";
