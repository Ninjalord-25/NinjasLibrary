It is scary. Truly scary.\" (HorrorNovelReviews.com on <i>The Demonic</i>)</p> <p>\"There's a slow build-up of dread, as he builds the characters and atmosphere, and slowly unwinds the story. At times, he dangles you over the edge for a few moments before he plunges you over the edge. And this is where his storytelling is a cut above many of his peers.\" (IntoTheMacabre.com on <i>The Mark</i>)</p> <p>\"I find that it’s often the details we least expect that elevate a novel’s status in our mind, and keep it there longer. A great testament to Mountford’s skill as a writer, is that I can still vividly 'see' many of the scenes in my mind, several books afterward. Highly recommended.\" (HorrorAfterDark.com on <i>Forest of the Damned</i>)</p>";
