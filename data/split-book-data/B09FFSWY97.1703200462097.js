window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Amid the dangers of the sea comes an epic fairy tale of pirates, monsters, adventure, and a love that was never meant to be.</b></p> <p>In the heart of the land of Zemira lives a king - a wicked king who despises magic.</p> <p>Using the enchanted crystal he wears upon his crown, he bounds magic to become a mere fairy tale, for it threatens his throne. While many succumb to its charm, others are immune, including a siren child and the fisherman who found her floating out in the sea.</p> <p>After 20 years of training with her adoptive father, Nola can no longer bear to watch the king destroy everything she loves. She must set sail to the Fae Kingdom and recruit an army of Elven warriors to overthrow the king. But traveling by sea would not come easy for her, for she has never used her tail.</p> <p>When a crew of unruly pirates visits Zemira's marketplace, Nola encounters the arrogant Captain Lincoln. Though unbelievably handsome, the pirate agitates her to no end with his cocky smile and sneer remarks. He quickly reminds her of her father's words - never trust a pirate.</p> <p>However, Nola knows the only way to the Fae queen is crossing the Portland Sea - and the pirates are sailing straight East. Nola takes the chance by stowing away on the Sybil Curse. But when she is caught hiding below deck, her presence is not entirely welcomed by Lincoln. The handsome captain agrees to take the siren to see the Fae queen, but she would be his prisoner until they reached dry land.</p> <p>During the seven-day journey, Nola and Lincoln come to feel things they never imagined. Amid massive waves, sea monsters, and dragons arises a bond no one ever expected - the love between a siren and her pirate.</p> <p><i>Listen to the adventure today!</i></p>";
