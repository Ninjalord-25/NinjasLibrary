window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Isaac is a lone wolf on a mission to stop an organization by the name of \"Testament\" from taking over the world. He knows that if they abuse the powers known as fluxions, the world will once again be thrown into chaos. While on his travels, he meets many interesting characters, including a mischievous wind child, a blue phoenix, an albino dragon, and an animated suit of armor. Of course, it takes Isaac a while to accept these strangers, who eventually teach him the benefits of teamwork and friendship. With their help, he heads to the main headquarters of Testament, a floating island known as The Eagle's Nest. However, in order to get there, they had to visit strange and exotic places, including the Peak of Eternal Light, the Walled city of Topal, Pandora Prison, and the Dendritic Forest. But even though Isaac has allowed these allies to tag along, he carries a secret burden that fuels his motivation to stop the use of fluxions. Armed with only a black katana and a white longsword, Isaac takes on the most powerful people in the world. Will he be able to prevent Testament from conquering the world, or is he the last hurdle they need to jump in order to complete their conquest? <i>First Name Basis </i>is a story of life, love, and honor. You've never seen science quite like this.&nbsp;</p>";
