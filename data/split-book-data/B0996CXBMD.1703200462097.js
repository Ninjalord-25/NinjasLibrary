window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Special Five-Year Anniversary Edition</p> <p>For fans of<i> Nightmare on Elm Street </i>and the 1989 classic <i>Heathers </i>comes<i> Dead by Morning</i>, a supernatural thriller that combines the angst of a high school drama and the gore of a nightmarish slasher.</p> <p>\"He was real, and he was a monster.\" Obsession is deadly. No one learns that better than Luna Ketz, a pessimistic high school senior. Caught between the intentions of her stern father and business-minded mother, boys are the last thing on Luna’s mind, but this fact doesn’t detour mysterious bad boy Chance Welfrey from trying to gain her affection. Luna doesn’t think twice about him until girls at their high school begin to disappear. Girls who tended to hurt her. Girls she wished would disappear. When she receives a call from a long-lost friend, normalcy goes out the window, as she’s plunged into the paranormal. There’s a world beneath the surface of the unconscious mind, and the killer knows how to navigate it. Luna is in danger, and although she can avoid the killer in reality, she cannot avoid him in her dreams.</p> <p>Rated for mature adult themes and depictions of violence.</p>";
