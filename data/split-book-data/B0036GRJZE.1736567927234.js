More confounding is the thick mask of bandages obscuring his face. Why does he disguise himself in this manner and keep himself hidden away in his room? <p>Aroused by trepidation and curiosity, the local villagers bring it upon themselves to find the answers. What they discover is a man trapped in a terror of his own creation, and a chilling reflection of the unsolvable mysteries of their own souls.</p> <p>In the tradition of Mary Shelleyï¿½s Frankenstein comes another undisputed classic of science fiction and horror to stir the imagination and conscience.</p>";
