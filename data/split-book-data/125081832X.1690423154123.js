Until one day his desperate mother sells him to the mysterious Master of Mordew.<br> <br> The Master derives his magical power from feeding on the corpse of God. But Nathan, despite his fear and lowly station, has his own strength - and it is greater than the Master has ever known. Great enough to destroy everything the Master has built. If only Nathan can discover how to use it.<br> <br> So it is that the Master begins to scheme against him - and Nathan has to fight his way through the betrayals, secrets, and vendettas of the city where God was murdered, and darkness reigns.<br> <br> Propulsive, compulsively readable, full of unforgettable characters <i>and</i> a talking dog who wants to be a philosopher, <i>Mordew</i> is an epic fantasy strange, new, and terrifyingly <i>alive</i>.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books</b></p>";
