That is, until he learns the town hides an ugly secret.&nbsp;</p> <p>A 30-year-old murder in the high school. And a frightening ghost stalking his new office. Burned by an earlier encounter with the spirit world, Darrell doesn't want to get involved, but when the desperate ghost hounds him, he concedes. Assisted by his new love, he follows a trail that leads to the civil rights movement, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and even the Klu Klux Klan.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then, when two locals who try to help are murdered, Darrell is forced to decide if he's willing to risk his life — and the life of the woman he loves — to expose the killers of a young man he never knew.</p>";
