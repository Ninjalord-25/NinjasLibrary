No one at her academy wanted an orc as a paladin, so they’ve sent her to the back end of a swamp, hoping she’ll never find a quest good enough to earn her shield. Well, screw that. Vola’s got divine help, and even a laughingstock of a goddess can do some righteous smiting.</p> <p>Armed with a new mission to find some missing orphans, Vola just needs a team to help her track them down. Beggars can’t be choosers, but couldn’t her goddess have sent her at least one competent fighter? Now, she’s stuck with a hyperactive halfling, a klutzy spell caster, and a cloaked mystery who’s a little too good with their knives. </p> <p>Can a half-orc paladin keep her new party alive in a swamp that’s determined to eat them, or are all the naysayers right and orcs really can’t be heroes?</p>";
