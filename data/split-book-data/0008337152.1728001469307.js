window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A sensational debut novel perfect for fans of <i>Outlander </i>and <i>The Binding</i>. This is Gothic, epic, romantic fantasy at it’s very best: a tale of magic, intrigue on dangerous waters and a love story for the ages. Perfect for fans of V.E. Schwab and China Mieville.</p> <p>Arden Beacon arrives in the salt-swept port of Vigil with a job to do. Tasked with using the magic in her blood to keep the lighthouse burning, she needs to prove herself worthy of her family name and her ancestors’ profession.</p> <p>But the coastline Arden must keep alight – battered by a sea teeming with colossal, ancient beasts – is far from the cultured, urban world she knows. It is a place of secrets, rumours and tight-lipped expectations of a woman’s place. More than anyone, the town folk whisper about Arden’s neighbour, Jonah Riven, the hunter of leviathans. They say he murdered his wife. They say he is as much a monster as his prey.</p> <p>Amidst all her determination and homesickness Arden cannot get this shadowy stranger out of her head. A plot swirls around the lighthouse keeper, the hunter and the authorities. Arden must make sense of these dark waters – before they wash her away.</p>";
