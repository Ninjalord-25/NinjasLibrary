window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Trick the humans, steal the gold, gain the power, achieve god-like status. The motivations of a Diabolical Dragon. </b></p> <p>Orion's unknown father...yeah, that shitty guy was a fey dragon. When Orion matures into a man, he spends a day in the snow transforming into a warehouse-sized dragon. Now he's hunted. Vile humans want to adorn his head as a trophy in their halls. Except, instead of letting the humans hound him, Orion blends in, swapping between dragon and human to carry out his diabolical plans.</p> <p>Warning: This novella is not for the faint of heart. It contains a bad guy...an actual villain. Does he have motivations? Sure, but he still is the Diabolical Dragon. Contains a magical fantasy setting where men use dowries for their daughters, monster fey are considered scum, and nobility can do just about anything they want if they have enough gold.</p> <p>This second edition contains all new chapters with 20 percent more content than before. Enjoy.</p>";
