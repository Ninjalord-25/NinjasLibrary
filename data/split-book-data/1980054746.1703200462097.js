Instead, these reluctant mercenaries uncover some hidden agendas and ancient power struggles centuries in the making.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>The last wizard king seeks a return to Tralodren after nearly eight centuries of exile. But doing so requires the manipulation of a band of mercenaries oblivious to his goals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The gladiator sold his soul for revenge. The knight's a bigot. The dwarf only cares about regaining his honor. Even the wizardess seems too bookish for anyone’s good. But they’ve all been hired by a blind seer and his assistant to retrieve some forgotten knowledge long hidden away in a jungle-strangled ruin.</p> <p>Betrayal, madness, adventure, and magic fill this first volume of the Wizard King Trilogy, introducing readers to a world rich in history, faith, and tales of adventure - of which this story is but one of many.</p>";
