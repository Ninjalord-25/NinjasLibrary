It was a ransom demand for $100,000. If it wasn’t paid within a week, the train and its 34 passengers would be blown up. He hurried out of his office and rushed through the early morning streets to tell the resident Union Pacific special agent of the kidnapped train. It was Nelson Cook’s problem now....</p>";
