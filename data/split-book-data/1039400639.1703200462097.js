window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When treading the path of ascension, you'd better watch your step. </b></p> <p>After incursions of demons from another plane of existence changed the course of history, humanity learned one undeniable truth: traditional weapons wouldn't cut it. Those strong enough to resist cultivated their Ki, and emerged as Heroes of Ascension to combat the demonic threat.&nbsp;</p> <p>For two hopeful Ascendants, J and Alex, this journey begins at Wyvern Academy. But surviving in one of the world's top battle academies isn't the only thing they have to worry about. Fellow students, rivals, beautiful girls, and treacherous exams stand in the way of their first steps on the path of ascension.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Wyvern Academy is a harem cultivation series inspired by Japanese Light Novels as well as a deep love and respect for anime, kung fu, martial arts, and battle academy adventures. It contains some explicit adult content, unconventional relationships, and violence.</i></p>";
