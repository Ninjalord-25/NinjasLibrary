Everything is going as great as can be for a vanilla human...until one misstep lands him in trouble with a noble of the Unseelie Fae. Caught between the wrath of a Fae Court and the desire of a Succubus Cabal, Cam must fight to survive, and figure out he might not be that normal after all. </p> <p><i>Courts and Cabals</i> contains adult situations and supernatural creatures that generally treat humans like s#!t. It's intended for a mature audience.</p>";
