The good kind, of course” (</b><b><i>BuzzFeed</i></b><b>) from the Jordan Peele of horror literature, Stephen Graham Jones.</b></p> <p><i>“Some girls just don’t know how to die…”</i></p> <p>Shirley Jackson meets <i>Friday the 13th</i> in <i>My Heart Is a Chainsaw</i>, written by the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Only Good Indians</i> Stephen Graham Jones, called “a literary master” by National Book Award winner Tananarive Due and “one of our most talented living writers” by Tommy Orange.</p> <p>Alma Katsu calls <i>My Heart Is a Chainsaw</i> “a homage to slasher films that also manages to defy and transcend genre.” On the surface is a story of murder in small-town America. But beneath is its beating heart: a biting critique of American colonialism, Indigenous displacement, and gentrification, and a heartbreaking portrait of a broken young girl who uses horror movies to cope with the horror of her own life.</p> <p>Jade Daniels is an angry, half-Indian outcast with an abusive father, an absent mother, and an entire town that wants nothing to do with her. She lives in her own world, a world in which protection comes from an unusual source: horror movies…<i>especially</i> the ones where a masked killer seeks revenge on a world that wronged them. And Jade narrates the quirky history of Proofrock as if it is one of those movies. But when blood <i>actually</i> starts to spill into the waters of Indian Lake, she pulls us into her dizzying, encyclopedic mind of blood and masked murderers, and predicts exactly how the plot will unfold.</p> <p>Yet, even as Jade drags us into her dark fever dream, a surprising and intimate portrait emerges…a portrait of the scared and traumatized little girl beneath the Jason Voorhees mask: angry, yes, but also a girl who easily cries, fiercely loves, and desperately wants a home. A girl whose feelings are too big for her body. <i>My Heart Is a Chainsaw</i> is her story, her homage to horror and revenge and triumph.</p>";
