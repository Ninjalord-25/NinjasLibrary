Anything you do inside your own home is allowed.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a dog-eat-dog world of millionaires and billionaires. The rest of society beneath them live in ignorance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Those at the top have money, tools, people, assassins, and murderers. One such assassin was a rumor, a myth, a ghost in the night. The Red Countess, the lady Valentina Winters.&nbsp;</p> <p>A player among the elite has something Valentina wants, and she is willing to do most anything to get it. Including his jobs. Theft of secrets, acquisition of passwords, perhaps a death or two if need be.&nbsp;</p> <p>That's power others in the hierarchy fear, and where there is fear, there are opportunities. When you play with an assassin, you had better be sure you don't get bit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Do those who desire Atlantica's secrets really care?&nbsp;</p> <p>It's all fun and games until the bodies start dropping. And that is fun so long as the bodies aren't theirs.</p>";
