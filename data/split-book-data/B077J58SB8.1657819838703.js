window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's hard enough being an undergraduate student, an intern at Downtown Manhattan's police station, and a bouncer at a local bar. Add her now-ex-boyfriend who recently dumped her for the school's resident bimbo - oh, and she's a werewolf. </p> <p>Mackenzie Grey meets her match when she is kidnapped by the Brooklyn Pack and tossed between Sebastian and Jonah - the Alpha and the Beta. Being a lone wolf in the city is dangerous, and now that the Pack has found her, so can every supernatural being in the Tri-State area. And not even her sarcastic, smart mouth can get her out of this. </p> <p>When a string of kidnappings involves Mackenzie in supernatural politics, she questions her new acquaintances and finds unlikely allies. Can she escape Pack law and keep her freedom - or will she be condemned to an unwanted path? </p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i> </p>";
