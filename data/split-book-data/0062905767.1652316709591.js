window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Shiloh Harrison was hoping for a few days off to recover from a particularly nasty assignment, preferably with the help of the talented hands (and, well, the rest of his body, too) of her sexy boyfriend Vincent. But when a group of vampires takes an entire trailer park hostage, there’s nothing to do but make her apologies and get to the scene.</p> <p>Such is the life of a Federal Marshal in the Paranormal Investigators Unit.</p> <p>Yet this isn’t like her typical track-and-nab case. Something is going on that has vampires scared, and it takes all her strength <i>not </i>to imagine what could frighten such powerful creatures. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have that option. Her boss is MIA; someone is snatching vampires; and there’s a ticking clock that can only end one way: a bloodbath.</p> <p>Unless she can stop it.</p> <p>The first book in a new series, <i>Stray Magic </i>is a dark and sexy mystery, with enough twists and curves to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.</p>";
