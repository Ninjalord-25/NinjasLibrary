window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I’m a kick-butt tracker. The best in the business.</b></p> <p>Dead or alive, I find them. No one can hide from me, including people’s predestined mates. I can hook couples up better than Tinder. It’s my specialty. A year ago, I opened my own agency, and now that I’m finally looking out for number one, my bank account has regained its lost confidence.</p> <p>So, when Jake Knight suddenly returns, determined to drag me back into the dangerous life I used to lead - the same one where ramen was a staple, and I became homeless - I put my brand-new Louis Vuitton boot down. He can take his hot werewolf self back to whatever hole he crawled from.</p> <p>Sure, it sucks there’s a supernatural war brewing, and the werewolf I used to date has gone missing, but Jake won’t drag me back into that life. No way. He can fight crime all on his lonesome. I’m done with it.</p> <p>Or at least that’s my goal until the attempts on my life begin, and I barely escape. Now, I have an ancient vampire on my tail and a hot werewolf reawakening our troubled past, and I must fight not to lose myself again.</p> <p>If you enjoy K.F. Breene, Shannon Mayer, Annette Marie, Jennifer Estep, and CN Crawford, then prepare to enjoy a witty heroine and her rekindling romance with the hot werewolf who broke her heart. Step into the Mate Tracker Agency and find your soulmate. </p> <p>This is an upper YA/NA crossover best suited for age 16+ since steaminess increases through the course of the series.</p>";
