(Well, wouldn’t you?)</li> <li><b>Demeter</b>, goddess of the harvest and mother of Persephone; <b>Artemis</b>, the hunter and goddess of wild spaces; the <b>Muses</b>, the <b>nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne</b>, the goddess of memory; and <b>Hestia</b>, goddess of domesticity and sacrificial fire.</li> </ul> <p>Infused with Haynes’s engaging charm and irrepressible wit, <i>Divine Might</i> is a refreshing take on the legends and stories we thought we knew.</p>";
