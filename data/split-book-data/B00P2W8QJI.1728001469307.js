window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Caldanâ€™s parents are brutally slain, he is raised by monks and taught the arcane mysteries of sorcery. Vowing to discover for himself who his parents really were, and what led to their violent end, he is thrust into the unfamiliar chaos of city life. With nothing to his name but a pair of mysterious heirlooms and a handful of coins, he must prove his talent to earn an apprenticeship with a guild of sorcerers. </p> <p>But he soon learns the world outside the monastery is a darker place than he ever imagined, and his treasured sorcery has disturbing depths. </p> <p>As a shadowed evil manipulates the unwary and forbidden powers are unleashed, Caldan is plunged into an age-old conflict that brings the world to the edge of destruction. </p> <p>This is an updated recording from the original 2014 edition, also performed by Oliver Wyman, which matches the current reissue of the print book. </p>";
