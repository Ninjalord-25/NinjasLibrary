window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'd love to tell you how I got stuck in a house in the middle of Nowhereville, Illinois. Or how many years I've spent with no memory of the person I used to be. But I can't. Those details are locked down tight inside the chaos of my mind, and I don't have the key.</p> <p>The only thing I do know - I'm dead. Major bummer, right?</p> <p>I spend my days doing what I do best - scaring off anyone who steps foot inside my house. Of course, ghost girls can't own houses, but that's beside the point. A girl's got a rep to maintain, and after a close call a while back, I've had to step up my game. This ghost girl doesn't want to be exorcised anytime soon.</p> <p>Just when my unlife is getting increasingly dull, a team of hot paranormal researchers shows up to investigate the cause of all the unusual activity. Now I don't know whether I should bust out my normal bag of tricks or take a chance on making my presence known in other, potentially naughty, ways. Don't judge. Ghost girls have needs too, you know, and mine have gone unmet for way too long.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
