But Alexander the Great broke the Capstone into seven pieces and hid them in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. <p>Now, in 2006, another Tartarus Rotation is due, and whoever places the reconstructed Capstone on the pyramid in time will gain absolute earthly power. Everyone wants the Capstone - from the most powerful countries to terrorists - and one daring coalition of eight small nations who think that no single country should possess such awesome power.</p>";
