Known as Arc, it is a place of isolation, a place to restart civilisation.</p> <p>A fireball grows ever larger in the skies and ancient enemies wing through the spaces; the world Massin is the gathering place for every omen of disaster. Every resident soul faces a choice. Time now to march south to the sanctuary, from the eastern highlands and the western seas, there to escape apocalypse, and the renewal of the war between the Ilfin and Glonu, or stay behind, hoping for a miracle.</p> <p>An Elemental will find the sanctuary - Lyra is gifted - a Warrior will defend the dispossessed - the boy Horin will grow up fast - and a Marsh Devil will lead them - Damin spends years preparing for this epic event - but it is also true that a sanctuary is not always a haven. Has the legend lied? Will Arc protect them?</p> <p>Prepare for an adventure that will journey from ancient ways of living into high-tech environments. Ilfin of Arc is a dystopian Fantasy tale that flies into star filled spaces - strap in!</p>";
