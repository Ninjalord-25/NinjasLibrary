window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All David Flinch ever wanted was a normal life. But when you're a member of the Flinch family, normal has never been easy.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, the eldest-born male of each generation of the Flinch family has been servant and guardian to the vampire, Lord Underwood. While the Flinches have changed through the generations, Underwood has remained eternal. David had hoped to be spared the horror of serving his family's lord and master, but when he is summoned to the Flinch home in Spain by his dying older brother, he knows his luck has run out.</p> <p>After 50 years of slumber, Underwood is to be resurrected from the grave in a ritual of human sacrifice, and David, by right of succession, is to be his resurrector. But there is another Flinch, one who craves the role of guardian to the vampire: David’s sister, Lydia. It’s a job she means to have, even if it means making David’s the first blood shed in this new age of Underwood and Flinch.&nbsp;</p> <p>Underwood and Flinch is a blackly humourous thriller of sibling rivalry and vampire horror set in a British expat community in rural Spain, with a sub-plot involving Russian mobsters on the Costa del Sol.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Underwood and Flinch</i> was podcast from 2008 - 2012, winning the coveted Parsec Award for Best Small Cast Story (Long Form) in 2012 and 2013.
