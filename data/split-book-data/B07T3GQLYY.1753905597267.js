Followed by a grizzly bear, also aggressive and resilient, even when point-blank shotgun blasts to the face are involved. <br> </p> <p>Now the cabin is surrounded by all manner of zombie creatures. Rusty and Mia have no way to call for help. The truck that could take them to safety is three miles away, stuck in the mud. <br> </p> <p>But Rusty and Mia have their courage. They have their wits. And, most importantly, they have an ax and a fully fueled chainsaw... </p>";
