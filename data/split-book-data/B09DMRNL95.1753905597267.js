The Trials offer the promise of power to any who can clear them, but Dabu has been forbidden from entering.</p> <p>After a violent encounter leaves his family in danger, Dabu faces a difficult decision: either leave the village to challenge the Trials, or stay and risk starvation. The Trials are monstrously difficult, filled with dangerous beasts, deadly obstacles, and tribes of challengers who control the areas within.
