And escaping it, avoiding the conflict around him, and keeping his own sanity will prove more difficult than he ever imagined</p> <p><b>\"A ripping yarn delivered with world-weary wit, bursting at the seams with sex, death, magic and madness.\" (Joe Abercrombie)</b></p> <p><b>\"This is historical fantasy done right.\" (</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly,</i></b><b> starred review)</b></p> <p><b>\"A&nbsp;highly enjoyable historical fantasy.\" (</b><b><i>Booklist)</i></b></p> <p><i>The Tower of Fools</i> is an historical novel set during&nbsp;the Hussite Wars in Bohemia during the 1400s,&nbsp;a period of religious conflict and persecution.
