Between the six pack abs and the extreme hangover, he can't decide if last night was a good thing or...something else.</p> <p>Hayden quickly discovers that, if left unchecked, this thirst could end up killing him, but only if he fails to find the woman who turned him.</p> <p>What's more, there's something unique about him, even among the vampires. Hayden isn't like the rest of them. There's something in his blood - something magical, almost otherworldly - and it's beginning to attract the wrong kind of attention.</p> <p>Warning: This book contains a harem, violence, and cursing.</p>";
