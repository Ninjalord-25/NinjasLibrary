window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After making an unexpected connection with God via his cell phone, one man embarks on an unlikely spiritual quest in this smart, savvy, rambunctious debut from author Rick Springfield. </p> <p>\"Why are we here? What is love? Is there a Loch Ness monster? Does God send text messages?\" These are the kinds of questions Horatio Cotton, aka Bobby Cotton, asks as he sets off on an uproarious adventure to find his purpose in life. After serendipitously stealing a mysterious self-help book called <i>Magnificent Vibration: Discover Your True Purpose</i> from a bookstore, Bobby calls the 1-800 number scrawled inside the front cover, only to discover that he has a direct line to God - and that God likes to mess with him. Soon enough, Bobby finds an ideal companion for his journey - the breathtakingly sexy and exceedingly sharp Alice - and they set out to find some combination of spiritual and carnal salvation...and possibly save the planet.</p>";
