His dream is jeopardized, however, when he learns his highly-publicized \"free meal\" risks putting The Sol Majestic into financial ruin. Kenna and a motley gang of newfound friends—including a teleporting celebrity chef, a trust-fund adrenaline junkie, an inept apprentice, and a brilliant mistress of disguise—must concoct an extravagant scheme to save everything they cherish. In doing so, Kenna may sacrifice his ideals—or learn even greater lessons about wisdom, friendship, and love. <br> <br> Utterly charming and out of this world, Ferrett Steinmetz's <i>The Sol Majestic </i>will satisfy the appetites of sci-fi aficionados and newcomers alike.</p>";
