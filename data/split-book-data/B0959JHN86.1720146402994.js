window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alex is a game developer, though he'd much rather stream RPG classics or spend time with Louie. That's his adorable corgi. He also hates people. Not in a homicidal way but rather in an extremely antisocial one.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unless you hurt Louie. In such an instant, Alex is pulled into the Apocosmos, where our whole world is just a blip in a colorful tapestry of a million others. A multiverse ruled by a strict system. Where Norse, Greek, and Celtic pantheons clash. Where dwarves craft, dragons hoard, and vampires don't glitter. A world that is as cruel as epic.</p> <p>Alex wants none of that though. He just wants to earn an early retirement somewhere in Spain. There's money to be made in the Apocosmos. Alex will take advantage of the market just like he did in his MMORPG days, in what seems like an error-proof plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it's a zero-sum game, and some people would do anything to eliminate competition.</p>";
