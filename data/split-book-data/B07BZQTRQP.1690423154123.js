window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Over Our Heads</i>, Book 3:</p> <p>Sean's still up to his neck in trouble, but at least he's finally found an example of his father's work, along with all of his notes. Now all Sean has to do is figure out not only how to reproduce his father's greatest achievement, but to solve the one problem his father wasn't able to. Holed up in a Cold War era bomb shelter, all Sean wants to do now is keep his head down and his family safe while he untangles this latest problem. Like it or not however, Sean has set events in motion that will change the future for all of the mages and supernatural beings involved, should he prove successful. While many may welcome these changes and the freedom it will bring them, some of the more powerful councils will most definitely not.</p> <p><i>Head Down</i>, Book 4:</p> <p>Things are starting to look up for Sean: he has a safe place to stay, allies, way too many wolves, and a couple of dangerously cute werefoxes around as well. However the other Councils now know that he's serious, after the raid on Gradatim that left several important people dead. Battle lines are starting to be drawn and the Council of the Ascendants realizes that they're next in line and start to take precautions while the other councils start to play politics and jockey for position. Even the Council of Vestibulum, the most powerful in both Reno and the rest of the country, is starting to be concerned. And how could any conflict between these major powers be complete without bringing back the assassin hired 12 years ago to deal with the son of the man he killed?</p> <p>Warning: <i>The Valens Legacy: Publisher's Pack 2</i> contains explicit sexuality, nudity, violence, bad language, attempted murder, actual murder, self-defense, pro-active self-defense, military-style raids, mass combat, destruction of private property, vandalism, breaking and entering, tantric magic, polyamory, mayhem, gratuitous sex and violence, an opportunistic goblin, a little girl who knows all about guilt trips, and Sean being completely and totally clueless about why his friend is embarrassed.</p>";
