window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fans of acclaimed author Kendare Blake's <i>Anna Dressed in Blood</i> will devour her latest novel, a dark and inventive fantasy about three sisters who must fight to the death to become queen. </p> <p>In every generation on the island of Fennbirn, a set of triplets is born: three queens, all equal heirs to the crown and each possessor of a coveted magic. Mirabella is a fierce elemental, able to spark hungry flames or vicious storms at the snap of her fingers. Katharine is a poisoner, one who can ingest the deadliest poisons without so much as a stomachache. Arsinoe, a naturalist, is said to have the ability to bloom the reddest rose and control the fiercest of lions. </p> <p>But becoming the Queen Crowned isn't solely a matter of royal birth. Each sister has to fight for it. And it's not just a game of win or lose...it's life or death. The night the sisters turn 16, the battle begins. </p> <p>The last queen standing gets the crown. </p>";
