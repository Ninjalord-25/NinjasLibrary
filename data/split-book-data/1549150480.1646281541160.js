window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In Gilded Age New York, a centuries-long clash between two magical families ignites when a young witch must choose between love and loyalty, power and ambition, in this magical novel by Louisa Morgan.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>In 1692, Bridget Bishop was hanged as a witch. Two hundred years later, her legacy lives on in the scions of two very different lines: one dedicated to using their powers to heal and help women in need; the other, determined to grasp power for themselves by whatever means necessary.&nbsp;</p> <p>This clash will play out in the fate of Annis, a young woman in Gilded Age New York who finds herself a pawn in the family struggle for supremacy. She'll need to claim her own power to save herself-and resist succumbing to the darkness that threatens to overcome them all.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Narrator Polly Lee brings her own brand of magic to a story of witches at a time when women were not allowed to be agents of their own destiny. Her vocal choices craft exceptionally bright and well-defined characters of different classes who embody distinct styles, and personalities. Her voices create a polished performance full of the vocal subtleties of a well-told story.\"&nbsp;(<i>AudioFile</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Morgan's beautifully conjured tale of three women, social mores, and the sanctity of self-determination is thoroughly enthralling.\"&nbsp;(<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Morganâ€™s incantatory prose and independent-minded women will delight fans of Alice Hoffman and Sarah Addison Allen with this tale of female self-realization and magical realism. A highly enjoyable read.\"&nbsp;(Historical Novel Society)&nbsp;</p> <p>From more from Louisa Morgan, check out:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>A Secret History of Witches</i></li> <li><i>The Witch's Kind </i></li> </ul>";
