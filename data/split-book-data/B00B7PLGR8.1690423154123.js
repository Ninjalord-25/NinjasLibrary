window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Morgan Beale is a pop icon - and hates every second of it. He begins adapting the latest best seller, <i>The Chihuahua in the Blue Prada Bag,</i> into a blockbuster movie just before his celebutante wife starts remodeling their Hollywood home, driving Beale to a hotel. Dodging the paparazzi one morning on his way to Starbucks, he spots his writing partner, Luke, who has been dead for over a decade, and who is staring into a mysterious hole in the ground. Driving headlong into the hole, they discover the surreal otherworld of Starbucks Nation, a film set littered with characters from Beales life and the novel he's adapting, including a talking Chihuahua and an elite commando unit of ethnic cookie-making elves. </p><p>Mercilessly lampooning our fascination with reality television, celebrity blunders, and mindless infotainment, <i>Starbucks Nation</i> brilliantly showcases the absurdities of modern society.</p>";
