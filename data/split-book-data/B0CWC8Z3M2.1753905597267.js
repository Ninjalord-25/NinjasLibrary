But a falling out with her best friend and bandmate has killed her dreams of escaping and making it big in the Atlanta punk scene.</p> <p>While helping her eccentric neighbor organize his religious artifacts, an ancient ring clamps down on her finger—possessing her with the spirit of a blood-thirsty demon. There’s no exorcizing it unless hundreds of people chant a spell to set Ruby free. And what’s worse, the ring is a beacon for evil, drawing an unimaginably wicked mob straight to Ruby, hungry for her flesh. </p> <p>If Ruby can get her band back together, she has a shot at salvation. It's time for her to face the music and put her whole soul into a song—one powerful enough to raise some Hell.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Nightfire.</b></p>";
