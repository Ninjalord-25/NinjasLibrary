Vicious monsters and widespread mists plague the lands. Nefarious gods and villainous agents work in concert to bring ruin.</p> <p>Urmatia needs heroes. That's where John comes in. He's a young boxer who died in one world and got a second chance to help a new one. It's a hard responsibility. Everything has a cost. But when other heroes crumble, John raises his fist, ready for more.</p> <p>The System is XP and level-up based. The unique part is the System-based abilities that can be learned through the collection of magic cores, little orbs that have magical abilities, and weapon artsâ€”a person has certain weapons that match them. There are quests, individual achievements, stats to gain, and recognition by the System for providing the greatest service/efforts during mass party quests, and more.</p>";
