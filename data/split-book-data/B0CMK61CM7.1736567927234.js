The local deputies grapple with petty vandalism and local drunks. The local teachers know the name of every kid in town. For Heather Bradley, it's a place that keeps her family safe and their lives in order; her biggest worries are the daily grind of her job and the kids coming home late. She doesn't know that unfathomable forces are set to converge on her town and thrust their neat lives into darkness, but when her oldest son Stuart opens a one-sided door in the woods and a black cloud pours out, the Bradleys and their whole town find themselves locked in a desperate struggle for survival. As the chaos grows and the nature of the real threat emerges, the only question becomes whether or not come morning the town will exist at all.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
