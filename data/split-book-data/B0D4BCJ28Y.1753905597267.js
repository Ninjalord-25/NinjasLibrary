That's when the problems started. For one, he wasn't heading for heaven. He was on a one-way trip to the other place.<br> <br> Secondly, an angel literally pulled him from the brink of Hell and gave him a choice: Go straight to Hell, don't pass go, don't collect $200. Or, be put inside the body of an alternate version of himself on a completely different Earth where magic, not technology, rules, and get a chance to redeem his soul.<br> <br> The catch? (Isn't there always a catch?)<br> <br> To earn a place in the afterlife, Hunter must stop an immortal creature called the Nightlord before it can destroy the Free Lands. Did the angel mention that it can't be hurt with normal weapons or magic.<br> <br> Piece of cake, right?<br> <br> <b>Don't miss the next action-packed LitRPG adventure from John Cressman, author of The Abduction Cycles!</b></p>";
