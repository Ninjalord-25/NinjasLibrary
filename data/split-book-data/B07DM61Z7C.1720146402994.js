window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You never mess with a young girl around James Brownstone. It doesn't matter what crime syndicate you belong to, that just doesn't sit well with him.</p> <p>The world has changed since the news of Oriceran came out 20 years before. Now, countries&nbsp;all over the world have agreed to using&nbsp;a bounty system&nbsp;for dangerous criminals using advanced magic or advanced technology. Magical criminals,&nbsp;thugs, and bounty hunters in the future, people too powerful for the cops to deal with, will revert to what worked in the past.</p> <p>If you find out you are hunted by Brownstone, we suggest you turn yourself in. It will save you a monumental ass-kicking.</p> <p>Brownstone&nbsp;likes his life simple, but life is about to throw him a wicked curveball.</p> <p>Download and kick back for a fun, action-packed adventure that will have you yelling for the good guys and laughing at just how much Brownstone can infuriate Shay. And, how thoroughly Shay mystifies Brownstone.</p> <p><i>Note: This book contains cursing - perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nevertheless. If this offends you, I don't suggest listening to this book.</i></p>";
