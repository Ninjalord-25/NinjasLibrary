A potential battle with both sea serpents and evil sorcerers.</b></p> <p>When Sorcerer Adrien Danvers takes on a job that leads him into the slums of England, he never imagined he'd end up with not one but two apprentices. Despite his doubts about himself, he's the only chance the two pre-teens have to escape their hellish life.</p> <p>When Sir Hugh Quartermain contracts him to deal with the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home on the Isle of Man, Adrien finds the more time they spend together, the more his walls come down around the beguiling engineer—an unusual occurrence and a terrifying prospect.</p> <p>As it turns out, this case is about to take a turn—a battle with both beast and man, the ultimate test of Adrien's willingness to accept help. When he does, Hugh proves to be a fierce protector and friend, more so than Adrien could've ever bargained for, and he finds himself longing for something he shouldn't.</p> <p>Falling for his new friend is not a complication Adrien needs. (His matchmaking apprentices disagree.)</p>";
