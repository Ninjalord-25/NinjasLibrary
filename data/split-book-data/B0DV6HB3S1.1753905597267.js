But those will have to wait as the tribal council has more important things for them to do when they get back to Vegas: deal with a bunch of organ-jackers who have been preying on the young women of several of the local tribes.</p> <p>Then, of course, there's still the problem Nate's been having with the good folks of Raycon Corporation, who really want a look inside his head. After having removed it from his body, of course. Having been gone for almost a month, he's hoping they've moved on, but only time will tell. Nate's also a little worried that Jin may have moved on, so he's very much looking forward to seeing her as soon as they get back to town.</p> <p>Then, there's Coyote, the trickster god who has very much taken an interest in Nate and Nash, as well as this little problem with the organ-jackers, which promises to make all of the outcomes very interesting.</p>";
