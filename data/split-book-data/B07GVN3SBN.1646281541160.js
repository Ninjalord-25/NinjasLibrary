window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One world of magic. One world of reason. Two lives intertwined in connection mistaken for a dream.</p> <p>By day, Kyrus Hinterdale lives the mundane life of a scribe. By night, he lives out the adventures of Brannis Solaran, a failed sorcerer turned knight. When Brannis leads his battalion into the forest on a routine scouting mission, they are overwhelmed by a goblin force. While leading the survivors to regroup and prepare the empire for the inevitable war, Brannis struggles to understand why a scribe from his own dreams, suddenly seems to be able to perform the magic he never could.</p> <p>As the two discover the reality of their connection, their comfortable lives begin to unravel. Now they have to share knowledge between worlds to stay a step ahead of the mysteries piling up. Who is behind the unprovoked goblin attacks? How will a world dominated by reason react to the presence of magic? Who is the quiet stranger in the woods who refuses to give his name? And who might be playing a deadly game, with pawns in both worlds?</p>";
