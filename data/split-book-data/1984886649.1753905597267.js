In fact, you’re paid big money to stay here - more than you’ve ever dreamed of. The catch? For nine months, you cannot leave the grounds, your movements are monitored, and you are cut off from your former life while you dedicate yourself to the task of producing the perfect baby. For someone else. </p> <p>Jane, an immigrant from the Philippines, is in desperate search of a better future when she commits to being a “Host” at Golden Oaks - or the Farm, as residents call it. But now pregnant, fragile, consumed with worry for her family, Jane is determined to reconnect with her life outside. Yet she cannot leave the Farm or she will lose the life-changing fee she’ll receive on the delivery of her child. </p> <p>Gripping, provocative, heartbreaking, <i>The Farm</i> pushes to the extremes our thinking on motherhood, money, and merit and raises crucial questions about the trade-offs women will make to fortify their futures and the futures of those they love. </p> <p><b>Nominated for the NAACP Image Award </b></p> <p><b>Longlisted for The Center for Fiction First Novel Prize</b></p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Farm</i></b></p> <p>“So many factors - gender, race, religion, class - may determine where you come down on the surrogacy debate.... Ramos plays with many of these notions in her debut novel, <i>The Farm</i>, which imagines what might happen were surrogacy taken to its high-capitalist extreme.... The stage is set for lively book chat.” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (Editors’ Choice)</p> <p>“A thrilling read.” (<i>New York</i>) </p> <p>“Grippingly realistic.” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)</p> <p>“Brilliant.” (<i>New York Post</i>)</p> <p>“A provocative idea, and Ramos nails it.... Crisp and believable, this smart debut links the poor and the one percent in a unique transaction that turns out to be mutually rewarding.” (<i>People</i>)</p> <p>“Wow, Joanne Ramos has written the page-turner about immigrants chasing what’s left of the American dream.... Truly unforgettable.” (Gary Shteyngart, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Super Sad True Love Story</i> and <i>Lake Success</i>)</p>";
