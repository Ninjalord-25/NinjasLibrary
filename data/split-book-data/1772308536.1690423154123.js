window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Secret Treaties</i>, audioook nine:</p> <p>Having killed Gradatim's pet demon, Sean now has to move onto Portland, a true Gradatim stronghold. When the Gradatim breaks the silence with an attack on Sean's family, Sean's response is drastic and immediate, yet the Gradatim cannot help but to escalate their own response. Pushed into a corner, Sean and the Lions' response is both drastic and deadly, sending shock waves through both magical and governmental organizations.</p> <p>Forced now into a two-front war as Sean has to deal with the consequences of his own actions, other parties start to take an interest in him and his crusade as politicians start to wrangle inside the government and council heads look to settle old scores as well as new ones, doing their best to take advantage of the changing dynamic in their own bids to gain power. But allies have a way of turning up in the places you least expect, and when it comes time to take a stand, there are still people who will stand for what is right.</p> <p><i>It Ain't Easy</i>, audibook 10:</p> <p>With his home now secure, Sean can take the time to start catching up on the million and one things he's been meaning to do but never quite seemed to have the time. However, life is really never that simple. Sean's two armies, run by his friend Chad and his great uncle Maitland, are coming across a few things hinting that the Vestibulum aren't ready to give up the fight quite yet.</p> <p>The government and its minions are still not quite sure what to make of Sean or the lions he claims to represent. Divisions exist at the highest levels, and when the president decides to open a line of communications, those who are opposed to the idea are quick to act. The problem, however, is that while politics may make for strange bedfellows, when dealing with forces that aren't quite human, discretion is highly advised before jumping into bed.</p> <p>Warning: <i>The Valens Legacy: Publisher's Pack 5</i> contains explicit sexuality, nudity, violence, a dandelion that was just minding its own business and being all proud because it was the first dandelion to ever grow in Africa, and some guy just picked it, and now there aren't any again, and a poor kid who just pissed himself.</p>";
