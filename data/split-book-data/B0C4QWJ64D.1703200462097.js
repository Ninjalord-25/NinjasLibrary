After struggling to confront his untouchable high school crush at her seventeenth birthday party, Jay adds another interest to his list—Dungeon Crawling in the face of the apocalypse.</p> <p>Jay meets a divine creature who chooses him to become a Champion. Someone with a leveling System, stats, skills, access to other dimensions containing dungeons filled with supernatural loot, and magical powers that’ll alter reality as they know it.</p> <p>Becoming a Champion comes with some issues. Global assassins want Jay and other Champions dead. Monsters are hungering to break out of their dungeons and raze Jay’s world. And Jay’s just one young guy trying to have fun with a Class that gets weirder as he evolves and masters his new gravity powers.</p>";
