window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I was the Ashlord—a primordial, an apex predator amongst beasts, commanding legions. I fell, despite my power, although not due to the strength of my enemies...but the betrayal of my own kind. </b></p> <p>A voice whispered to me as I lay dying on the cold ground, promising rebirth and revenge. Accepting his offer, I fell into a timeless sleep.</p> <p>I awaken to the cold and crushing dark of a forgotten grave and discover that I have changed. No longer a primordial force of nature, I now inhabit the body of a once immortal cultivator, the very same one that tried to claim my core as I lay dying. He is part of me now, a fragment, sharing space with the Ashlord, and the tricky spirit that pulled us all together.</p> <p>What am I now? And will I be able to resist the siren song of revenge and redemption?</p>";
