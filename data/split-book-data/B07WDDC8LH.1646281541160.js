window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine TV's <i>Family Guy, Game of Thrones, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</i>, and Harry Potter all had a group gang-bang. <i>The Book of Roderick</i> would be the offspring created by that shameful night.&nbsp;</p> <p>Roderick and his best friend Horace discover a magical book left for Roderick by his father. Upon reading the book out loud, the moronic misfits are transported back to medieval times to the fictional location in the book: Candiace Kingdom. Despite possessing the combined IQ of a functionally average man, Roderick and Horace are forced to navigate through an impending war, and a population ripe with lies, treachery, seduction, and danger in order to find their way back home.&nbsp;</p> <p>Easily the most ridiculous, offensive book ever written, <i>The Book of Roderick: Medieval Mayhem</i> is book one of an upcoming series by author Eric Falvey. Full of punchlines, and with all the perverted, beer-soaked, hilarious shenanigans you could ever want, this is book is sure to delight anyone who enjoys envelope-pushing hilarity, and/or partakes in the Devil's Lettuce.</p>";
