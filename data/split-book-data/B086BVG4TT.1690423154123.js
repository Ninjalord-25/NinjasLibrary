The only caveat to the game: There is no manual. The only instruction the player gets is how to interact with the user interface. That's it. Nobody is going to hold their hand or give out rare items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Players begin life as a level-zero commoner. It's entirely up to them what class they become.&nbsp;</p> <p>Explore a world that spans five continents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Liam is tricked into trying an expensive and innovative online MMO. On his first trip into the game, he stumbles upon a hidden class: the Undead Necromancer. Intrigued by this turn in events, he continues to explore this mysterious world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In another part of the country, Kathrine (Kat) suffers from a debilitating and paralyzing disease. Taking part in an experimental research could offer her a new lease on life (of a sort).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Even further afield, Russia and China are undergoing a massive spike in suicide rate. What could be causing so many young adults to dire ends?</p>";
