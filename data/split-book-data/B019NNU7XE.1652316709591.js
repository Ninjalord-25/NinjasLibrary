window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Soon to be a major motion picture starring Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba!</p> <p>In the first book of this brilliant series, Stephen King introduces listeners to one of his most powerful creations: Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In his desolate world, which frighteningly mirrors our own, Roland tracks The Man in Black, encounters an enticing woman named Alice, and begins a friendship with the boy from New York named Jake. </p> <p>Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, <i>The Gunslinger</i> leaves listeners eagerly awaiting the next chapter. </p>";
