window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A beguiling novel of revenge, deliverance, and a powerful sisterhood of magic by the </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Vine Witch</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Glamourist</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Sidra didn’t murder her husband. Yet even a jinni can’t wish away a wrongful imprisonment. Determined to prove her innocence, she returns to her adopted home - a French village renowned for its perfume witches - with her friends Elena and Yvette by her side. Here is where Sidra’s true destiny awaits, but danger also lurks in the village’s narrow lanes.&nbsp;</p> <p>On her trail is Jamra, another jinni, who’s after more than revenge for the murder of his brother. He also seeks vengeance for the indignities inflicted on jinn by mortals over the centuries. When he learns of an ancient relic capable of unleashing chaos on the world, and that the weapon is in the hands of his murderous sister-in-law, he vows to destroy Sidra to get it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Relying on a sisterhood of magic, a mysteriously faithful dog, and a second-rate sorcerer, Sidra defends herself using the village’s greatest asset: its perfume. It’s as beguiling a lure as it is a formidable shield. But is it enough for Sidra to protect herself and those she loves from powers yet to be released?</p>";
