But to prove her ultimate loyalty to her peers, she must betray the surgeon who saved her life. </p> <p><b>Two lovers will dare to risk all.</b> </p> <p>Eidolon cannot resist this fiery, dangerous woman who fills him with both rage and passion. Not only is she his avowed enemy, but she could very well be the hunter who has been preying upon his people. Torn between his need for the truth and his quest to find his perfect mate before a horrific transformation claims him forever, Eidolon will dare the unthinkable - and let Tayla possess him, body and soul.</p>";
