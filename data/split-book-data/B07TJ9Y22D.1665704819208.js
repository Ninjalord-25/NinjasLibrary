window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bounty hunters. Ninjas. Anthropomorphic musk oxen from the moons of Gartosh. Welcome to the gut-busting universe of Duke LaGrange!&nbsp;</b></p> <p>When bounty hunter Duke LaGrange and his oft-inebriated Japanese-Irish ninja companion, Ishiro’shea, entered their favorite watering hole, Cyborg Joe’s Grill N’ Go &amp; The Why Not Saloon, they had no idea that they would soon be gobbled up by an unhinged astral anomaly and deposited on an uncharted primitive world. Few things are worse than undeveloped planets, especially those that haven’t even made it to the soufflé stage. To top it off, this particular planet comes with its own insane ruler and an Orb That Controls Everything and Must Be Respected. The bounty hunting duo will need to navigate a violent rebellion, flying fire-breathing panthers, and mutated swamp cannibals in order to avoid being stranded light years from the nearest well-made martini.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>How to Pick Up Women with a Drunk Space Ninja</i> is the first book in The Adventures of Duke LaGrange, a series of hilarious sci-fi adventure romps from the creative mind of Jay Key. You are sure to fall in love with Key’s menagerie of colorful characters and laugh-out-loud storytelling talents.</p>";
