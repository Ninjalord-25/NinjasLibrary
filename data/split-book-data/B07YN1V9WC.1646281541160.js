window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Three terrifying novels in one collection from master of horror, Lee Mountford. </b><b><i>The Demonic</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Mark</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Forest of the Damned</i></b><b> are now all available in one horrifying volume.</b></p> <p><b><i>The Demonic</i></b>: A woman returns to her childhood home to lay to rest the ghosts of the past. But in this house, the ghosts are real, and evil has found a home.</p> <p><b><i>The Mark</i></b>: A satanic cult. A woman's brutal assault. Can one woman face her darkest fears before a demonic entity is unleashed from the depths of hell?</p> <p><b><i>Forest of the Damned</i></b>: A group of paranormal researchers investigate the infamous Black Forest, hoping to find proof of the afterlife and learn more of the infamous Mother Sibbett. But what they find is far beyond even their worst nightmares.</p> <p><b>Listen to</b><b><i> The Supernatural Horror Collection</i></b><b> now, and strap in for three terrifying tales of ghosts, demons, death, and fear.</b></p> <p>\"<i>The Demonic</i>, by author Lee Mountford, is a horror tour de force.... It is scary. Truly scary.\" (HorrorNovelReviews.com on <i>The Demonic</i>)</p> <p>\"There's a slow build-up of dread, as he builds the characters and atmosphere, and slowly unwinds the story. At times, he dangles you over the edge for a few moments before he plunges you over the edge. And this is where his storytelling is a cut above many of his peers.\" (IntoTheMacabre.com on <i>The Mark</i>)</p> <p>\"I find that it’s often the details we least expect that elevate a novel’s status in our mind, and keep it there longer. A great testament to Mountford’s skill as a writer, is that I can still vividly 'see' many of the scenes in my mind, several books afterward. Highly recommended.\" (HorrorAfterDark.com on <i>Forest of the Damned</i>)</p>";
