His empire toppled, his entourage dispersed, and his stain upon the cosmic landscape wiped clean. And that is exactly what Jackson, the newly graduated Titan, wants Eris Pence and the gods of the multiverse to think.</p> <p>After two years of secret training, Jackson is ready to begin his rampage, his mission of sweet revenge. The only things standing between him and his dark desires are a few pesky personality tests and a Titan named Frank.</p> <p><i>Villains Return</i> is the fifth book in the award-winning Shadow Master series and something of a whirlwind tour of Jackson’s greatest hits. This action-packed dark comedy calls back to several beloved locations, ties up more than a few loose ends, and forces Jackson to see beyond his immediate goals.
