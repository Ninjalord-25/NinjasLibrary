He's never truly been angry before in his life, and the anger he's dealing with isn't even coming from him! It's coming from the djevels.</p> <p>His lion side, he's discovered, is far less affected by it than his dark elf, which only makes sense when you consider his dark elf heritage. If he wants to pull himself back together, he needs to understand&nbsp;just&nbsp;what he's dealing with and how to manage it.</p> <p>Then, of course, there are the other djevels out there, more he needs to bring under his banner. Prince Bratsch will undoubtedly be looking westwards toward those lands that once belonged to the former Prince Talt's now-dead lords.</p> <p>Last of all, there is that nascent hotel business of his and Sawyer's. Nobody ever saw through Superman's glasses disguise. Maybe Mihalis can do the same with those horns?</p> <p>WARNING: Warning dot exe cannot be found.
