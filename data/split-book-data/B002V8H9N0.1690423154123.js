window.bookSummaryJSON = "Tom Wallace lived an ordinary life, until a chance event awakened psychic abilities he never knew he possessed. Now, he's hearing the private thoughts of the people around him - and learning shocking secrets he never wanted to know. But as Tom's existence becomes a waking nightmare, even greater jolts are in store, as he becomes the unwilling recipient of a compelling message from beyond the grave. <p>This eerie ghost story, by the award-winning author of <i>Hell House</i> and <i>I Am Legend</i>, inspired the acclaimed 1999 film starring Kevin Bacon.</p>";
