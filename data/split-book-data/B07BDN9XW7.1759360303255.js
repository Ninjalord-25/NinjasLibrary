Here are all the ways your trip into the friendly skies can turn into a nightmare, including some we’ll bet you’ve never thought of before... but now you will the next time you walk down the jetway and place your fate in the hands of a total stranger. </p> <p>Featuring brand-new “standouts” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) by Joe Hill and Stephen King, as well as 14 classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Dan Simmons, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and many others, <i>Flight or Fright</i> is, as King says, “ideal airplane reading, especially on stormy descents…Even if you are safe on the ground, you might want to buckle up nice and tight.” </p> <p>Each story is introduced by Stephen King and all will have you thinking twice about how you want to reach your final destination. </p>";
