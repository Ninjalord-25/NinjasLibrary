window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are no good guys in the world of shadows...but maybe some bad men are better than others.&nbsp;</p> <p>Derek Hawthorne was born to be an agent of the Red Room. Literally. Raised in a conspiracy which has protected the world from the supernatural for centuries, he's never been anything other than a servant of their agenda. Times are changing, though, and it may not be long before their existence is exposed.&nbsp;</p> <p>When a routine mission uncovers the latest plan of the magical terrorist, the Wazir, Derek finds himself saddled with a new partner. Who is the mysterious but deadly Shannon O'Reilly? What is her agenda? Couple this with the discovery the Red Room has a mole seeking to frame Derek for treason, and you have a plot which might bring down a millennium-old organization.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can he stop the Wazir's mission to expose the supernatural? And should he?</p>";
