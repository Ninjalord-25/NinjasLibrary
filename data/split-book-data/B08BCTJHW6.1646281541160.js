window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>\"If you had not already realized it, this is a very strange house you are come to.\"</i></p> <p>The Scions of the House of Werth are all born normal. It is what happens afterwards that sets them apart.</p> <p>It is not easy being the most supernatural family in England. Nell talks to the dead; Lord Werth is too often to be found out in the churchyard at the dead of night; and the less said about Lord Bedgberry, the better.</p> <p>Only Miss Gussie Werth has missed out on the family curse. She sups on chocolate, not blood; she's blissfully oblivious to spectres (except for Great-Aunt Honoria, of course); and she hasn't the smallest inclination to turn into a beast upon the full moon, and go ravening about the countryside.</p> <p>But there's more to the Wyrde than meets the eye. When a visit to a neighboring family goes spectacularly, deliciously wrong, Gussie's ideas about her own nature undergo a swift and serious change.</p> <p>Far from being the most ordinary of the bunch, she may just prove to be the most disastrous Werth of them all...</p> <p><i>Refined Regency manners meet gothic comedy to delightfully absurd effect in Wyrde and Wayward, a fresh new series from the author of Modern Magick and the Malykant Mysteries.&nbsp;</i></p>";
