window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>The audiobook of <i>Hogfather </i>is narrated by the BAFTA award-winning actor Sian Clifford (<i>Fleabag</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Quiz</i>). BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>; <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.&nbsp;</p> <p>'Humans need fantasy to be human. To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.'</p> <p>'Twas the night before Hogswatch and all through the house…something was missing.</p> <p>Superstition makes things work in the Discworld and undermining it can have consequences. When Death realizes that belief in the Hogfather is dangerously low, he decides to take on the job. But it's just not right to find a seven-foot skeleton creeping down your chimney and trying to say 'ho, ho, ho'.</p> <p>It's the last night of the year, the time is turning, and if Susan, gothic governess and Death's granddaughter, doesn't sort everything out by morning, there won't be a morning. Ever again…&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Hogfather </i>is the fourth book in the Death series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first book in the Discworld series – <i>The Colour of Magic</i> – was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
