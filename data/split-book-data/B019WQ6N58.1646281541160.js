window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Stephen King's \"gem of a story\" (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) about a child with extraordinary psychic powers who is on the run from the government. A number-one national best seller. </p> <p>Andy McGee and Vicky Tomlinson participated in a drug experiment run by a veiled government agency known as The Shop. One year later, they marry. Two years later, their little girl, Charlie, sets her teddy bear on fire by simply staring at it. </p> <p>Now that Charlie is eight, she doesn't start fires anymore. Her parents have taught her to control her pyrokinesis, the ability to set anything - toys, clothes, even people - aflame. But The Shop knows about and wants this pigtailed \"ultimate weapon\". Shop agents set out to hunt down Charlie and her father in a ruthless chase that traverses the streets of New York and the backwoods of Vermont. </p> <p>\"Terrifying and gripping\" (<i>The Miami Herald</i>) <i>Firestarter</i> is chilling proof that \"Stephen King is superb\" (<i>Time</i>). </p>";
