window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It has been thousands of years since beast-kind were united under one banner. The empire encompasses most of the known world, driving out or enslaving the lesser races without mercy. In a state of constant war and conquest, they have perfected the art of battle.</p> <p>For commoner wolf-kind Valian, being accepted and trained in a noble house's army was a dream come true. Without wealth or a family, it was his best shot at attaining honor and glory. Until fate intervened.</p> <p>When, on his graduation day, Valian discovers he's descended from an ancient and long-thought-extinct line, everything changes. Now, he'll have to come to terms with his newfound strength while joining a world he has never known. If the threat of his fellow beast-kind wasn't enough, a new danger has awoken on the empire's eastern border.</p> <p>If Valian doesn't rise to the occasion, more than just his own life may be lost.</p> <p><b>Fans of </b><b><i>Throne of Glass</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Sword of Truth</i></b><b> will enjoy the dynamic combination of magic and action in Evansâ€™ new series, Alpha Rising. </b><b><i>Dark Wolf's Awakening</i></b><b> is the debut novel in the fast-paced epic fantasy series that introduces listeners to a savage world ruled by shape-shifters and the beast within.</b></p>";
