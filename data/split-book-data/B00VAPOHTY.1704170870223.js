window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>\"The Gateway is openâ€¦.\"</i> </p> <p>These cryptic words wake college student Jess Ballard from a terrifying dream into an even more terrifying reality. Jess' life has never been what anyone would call easy; doing damage control in the wake of your nomadic, alcoholic mother doesn't exactly make for a storybook childhood. But now her world has fallen apart just when it should be coming together: her mother gone - dead under mysterious circumstances; her life uprooted to stay with estranged relatives she's never met; and there's something odd about some of the people she's been meeting at school: </p> <p><i>They're dead.</i> </p> <p>Aided by Tia, her neurotic roommate, and Dr. David Pierce, a ghost-hunting professor, Jess must unravel the mystery behind her hauntings. But the closer she gets to the truth, the more danger shadows her every move. An ancient secret, long-buried, is about to claw its way to the surface, and nothing can prepare Jess for one terrifying truth: her encounters with the world of the dead are only just beginning. </p>";
