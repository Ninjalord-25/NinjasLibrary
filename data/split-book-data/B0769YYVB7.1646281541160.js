window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A child of two worlds - belonging to neither, dangerous to both. </p> <p>All Kisaki really wants is to belong somewhere, but there are few places half demons can safely call home. Raised in isolation within the celestial palace, she longs to escape and explore the strange planet below - Earth. So when an opportunity presents itself, she takes it, inadvertently stealing her mother's greatest treasure in the process - the Blade of Heaven. </p> <p>Exploring a whole new world is terrifying enough, but hot on her heels is her so-called guardian, the tiger-spirit Shitoro. If he catches her, he'll drag her straight back home. She thinks it's to punish her. But in actuality it's to save her. </p> <p>She doesn't know it yet, but there's a very good reason Kisaki has been kept hidden away. Half-breeds such as her are not tolerated by the demon lords. If they find her, they'll stop at nothing to take the blade and use it to erase Kisaki, her mother, and everyone she cares about from existence. </p> <p><i> A new adult urban fantasy.</i> </p> <p><i>Midnite's Daughter</i> is book one of the Midnight Girl Saga, a manga inspired fantasy series by Rick Gualtieri - author of <i>Bill the Vampire</i>. </p>";
