window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>History's oldest man spills his beans in this tell-all autobiography, written originally on stone tablets. Methuselah shares his recollections of Adam (his great-great-great-great grandfather) and Eve, a woman he refers to as Madame Eve. He tells of his concerns that his son Noah is building a giant boat 25 miles from the nearest ocean and his fear that people will believe rumors Noah is involved in a massive investment scandal. Meth's views on suffrage for the women of his day will surprise you, as his thoughts on his uncles Cain and Abel. A must-listen for any serious student of history, now made much more accessible as in its original version (carved into stone) the weight of the book exceeded many hundreds of tons.</p>";
