window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This spine-tingling middle-grade collection brings together </b><b><i>Skeleton Man</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Return of Skeleton</i></b> <b><i>Man</i></b><b> - two modern classics that will chill you to the bone. R.L. Stine, best-selling author of the Goosebumps series, raved: “This book gave </b><b><i>me</i></b><b> nightmares!”</b></p> <p>Molly’s father grew up on the Mohawk Reserve of Akwesasne, where he learned the best scary stories. One of her favorites was the legend of Skeleton Man, a gruesome tale about a man with a deadly, insatiable hunger. But ever since her parents mysteriously vanished, those spooky tales have started to feel all too real.</p> <p>Things go from bad to worse for Molly when a stranger shows up one day and claims to be her great-uncle. A ghostly thin man she’s never seen before. A man who reminds her an awful lot of the Skeleton Man. But he couldn’t possibly be the same person from her father’s tale...could he?&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s up to Molly to uncover the truth about this fearsome figure and rescue her parents before it’s too late.</p> <p>This two-in-one collection is perfect for fans of R.L. Stine, Ellen Oh’s Spirit Hunters series, Holly Black’s <i>Doll Bones</i>, and any young learner who loves a good thrill.</p>";
