He is all talk and does not have any plan other than criticizing the authority system. He adds background knowledge and insight into the happenings of hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Guide (Various personalities)</p> <p><i>The Hitchhikers Guide</i> is not a book but rather a sentient being with God-like powers, but also dysfunctional split personalities.
