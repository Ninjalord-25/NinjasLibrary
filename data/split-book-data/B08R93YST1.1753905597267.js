I’m sentenced to a reform school for magical delinquents... though really, it’s a prison. <br> <br> As the only supernatural who can control both fire and water, I’m already a target. To make matters worse, I literally share a soul with Charlie, a sexy inmate from the wrong side of the tracks. Surviving at the Institute is almost as risky as falling in love. <br> <br> But there’s a way out. The Warden is offering a pardon for the team who wins the Darke Games—a sick, twisted competition where more prisoners come out dead than alive. <br> <br> They think I'm the bad guy. I'm about to show them just how much of a villain I can be. <br> <br> <b>Charlie</b> <br> <br> I shouldn’t be at the Institute. I’m in here because of her— the girl who claims to own half my soul. <br> <br> After losing my sight, I grew up as an orphan, banished from magical society. I learned enough on the streets to survive the gangs and fight clubs inside the prison. But nothing could prepare me for the Darke Games. <br> <br> Ava-Marie is my worst enemy, but if we’re going to break out of here, we’ll have to get along. Yet the more I let Ava in, the more I want her. I can’t let my desire for her get in the way of my one chance at escape. <br> <br> Except it already has. There’s a dark power inside of Ava that terrifies me... <br> <br> And none of us will be prepared when it unleashes.</p>";
