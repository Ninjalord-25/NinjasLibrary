window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For more than 1600 years, Nick Medea has followed and guarded the Gate that keeps the mortal realm and that of Feirie separate, seeking in vain absolution for the fatal errors he made when he slew the dragon.&nbsp;</p> <p>All that while, he has tried and failed to keep the woman he loves from dying over and over. Yet in the 50 years since the night the dragon breathed over the city of Chicago, the Gate has not only remained fixed, but open to the trespasses of the Wyld, the darkest of the Feiriefolk.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not only does that mean an evil resurrected from Nickâ€™s own past but also the reincarnation of his lost Cleolinda, a reincarnation destined once more to die. Nick must turn inward to that which he distrusts the most: the dragon...the beast he slew when he was still only Saint George.&nbsp;He must turn to the monster residing in him, now a part of him but ever seeking escape.&nbsp;</p> <p>The gang war brewing between Prohibition bootleggers may be the least of his concerns. If Nick cannot prevent an old evil from opening the way between realms, then not only might Chicago face a fate worse than the Great Fire, but so will the rest of the mortal realm.</p>";
