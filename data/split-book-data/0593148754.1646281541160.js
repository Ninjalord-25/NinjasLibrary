window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four destinies collide in a unique fantasy world of war and wonders, where empire is won with enchanted steel and magical animal companions fight alongside their masters in battle.</b></p> <p><b>Named one of the best books of the year by NPR, Tordotcom, and </b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>A soldier with a curse</b></p> <p>Tala lost her family to the empress' army and has spent her life avenging them in battle. But the empress' crimes don’t haunt her half as much as the crimes Tala has committed against the laws of magic...and against her own flesh and blood.</p> <p><b>A prince with a debt</b></p> <p>Jimuro has inherited the ashes of an empire. Now that the revolution has brought down his kingdom, he must depend on Tala to bring him home safe. But it was his army who murdered her family. Now Tala will be his redemption - or his downfall.</p> <p><b>A detective with a grudge</b></p> <p>Xiulan is an eccentric, pipe-smoking detective who can solve any mystery - but the biggest mystery of all is her true identity. She’s a princess in disguise, and she plans to secure her throne by presenting her father with the ultimate prize: the world’s most-wanted prince.</p> <p><b>A thief with a broken heart</b></p> <p>Lee is a small-time criminal who lives by only one law: <i>Leave them before they leave you</i>. But when Princess Xiulan asks her to be her partner in crime - and offers her a magical animal companion as a reward - she can’t say no, and she soon finds she doesn’t want to leave the princess behind.</p> <p>This band of rogues and royals should all be enemies, but they unite for a common purpose: to defeat an unstoppable killer who defies the laws of magic. In this battle, they will forge unexpected bonds of friendship and love that will change their lives - and begin to change the world.</p>";
