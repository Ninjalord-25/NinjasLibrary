Leaving “the city” is hard, but the blow is softened when they stumble upon a surprisingly affordable house in the suburbs. <br> <br> For Tom, the bills, the mortgage, and Jenny's unexpected pregnancy add up to terror. He's not ready for this kind of responsibility. <br> <br> Then he finds the thing in the basement. It makes him feel like a winner even as it scrambles his senses.
