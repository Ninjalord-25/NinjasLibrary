window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Neal Barrett, Jr., answers (sometimes) to a number of names: Odd, Weird, Gonzo, and, as a former collection points out: Slightly Off Center. Barrett is all of the above, and more. From fans who have followed his career come accolades such as brilliant, unique, sheer genius. Other writers respect his status as a master of words, his ability to weave rhythm and poetry into his tales.&nbsp;</p> <p>Barrett jumps in and out of genres at will, or simply invents one of his own. He likes to bring his favorite characters together and see what they'll do.&nbsp;</p> <p>Neal Barrett, Jr., has made a special effort to give us a number of dark, funny, and hopefully impossible views of the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Clearly, Nostrodamus missed the boat. Listen and enjoy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stories included in this collection:&nbsp;</p> <p>In the Shadow of the Worm&nbsp;</p> <p>To Plant a Seed&nbsp;</p> <p>The Stentorii Luggage&nbsp;</p> <p>A Walk on Toy&nbsp;</p> <p>The Flying Stutzman&nbsp;</p> <p>Nightbeat&nbsp;</p> <p>Hero&nbsp;</p> <p>Survival Course</p>";
