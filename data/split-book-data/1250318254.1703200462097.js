window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Everything epic fantasy should be: rich, cruel, gorgeous, brilliant, enthralling and deeply, deeply satisfying. I loved it.\" (Lev Grossman, author of <i>The Magicians</i>)</p> <p>Jenn Lyons begins the Chorus of Dragons series with The Ruin of Kings, an epic fantasy audiobook about a man who discovers his fate is tied to the future of an empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When destiny calls, there's no fighting back.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kihrin grew up in the slums of Quur, a thief and a minstrel's son raised on tales of long-lost princes and magnificent quests. When he is claimed against his will as the missing son of a treasonous prince, Kihrin finds himself at the mercy of his new family's ruthless power plays and political ambitions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Practically a prisoner, Kihrin discovers that being a long-lost prince is nothing like what the storybooks promised. The storybooks have lied about a lot of other things, too: dragons, demons, gods, prophecies, and how the hero always wins.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then again, maybe he isn't the hero after all. For Kihrin is not destined to save the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>He's destined to destroy it.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><b> Best Books of the Year - 2019 <br> </b><b><i>Kirkus</i></b><b> Reviews Best Books of the Year - 2019</b></p>";
