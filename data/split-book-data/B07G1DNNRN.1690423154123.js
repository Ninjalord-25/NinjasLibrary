Swarming from their prison, they multiply and thrive. To scream, even to whisper, is to summon death.</p> <p>Deaf for many years, Ally knows how to live in silence. Now, it is her family's only chance of survival. They must leave their home, shun others, and find a remote haven where they can sit out the plague. But will it ever end? And what kind of world will be left?</p>";
