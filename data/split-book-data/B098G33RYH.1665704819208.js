window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Kaiju Preservation Society</i></b> <b>is John Scalzi's first stand-alone adventure since the conclusion of his</b> <b><i>New York Times</i></b> <b>best-selling Interdependency trilogy.</b></p> <p>When COVID-19 sweeps through New York City, Jamie Gray is stuck as a dead-end driver for food-delivery apps. That is, until Jamie makes a delivery to an old acquaintance, Tom, who works at what he calls “an animal rights organization”. Tom’s team needs a last-minute grunt to handle things on their next field visit. Jamie, eager to do anything, immediately signs on.</p> <p>What Tom doesn't tell Jamie is that the animals his team cares for are not here on Earth. Not our Earth, at at least. In an alternate dimension, massive dinosaur-like creatures named Kaiju roam a warm and human-free world. They're the universe's largest and most dangerous panda, and they're in trouble.</p> <p>It's not just the Kaiju Preservation Society who's found their way to the alternate world. Others have, too. And their carelessness could cause millions back on our Earth to die.&nbsp;</p>";
