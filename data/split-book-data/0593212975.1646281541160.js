window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ghost stories tap into our most primal emotions as they encourage us to confront the timeless question: What comes after death? Here, in tales that are by turn scary, funny, philosophic, and touching, you’ll find that question sharpened, split, reconsidered - and met with a multitude of answers.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>A spirit who is fated to spend eternity reliving the exact moment she lost her chance at love, ghostly trees that haunt the occupant of a wooden house, specters that snatch anyone who steps into the shadows, and parakeets that serve as mouthpieces for the dead: These are just a few of the characters in this extraordinary compendium of 100 ghost stories. Kevin Brockmeier’s fiction has always explored the space between the fantastical and the everyday with profundity and poignancy. As in his previous books, <i>The Ghost Variations</i> discovers new ways of looking at who we are and what matters to us, exploring how mysterious, sad, strange, and comical it is to be alive - or, as it happens, not to be.&nbsp;</p>";
