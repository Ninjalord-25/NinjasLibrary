As a necromancer, it's my job to police the spirits while they remain stuck and, well, problematic a lot of the time. Death really needs to take his head out of his backside and get back to work, wherever he might be.</p> <p>After a horrible incident in the tunnels of the London Underground, my life takes a sharp turn. It's all my fault and I'm sent off to a small town, a move to keep me out of sight and mind for the time being. Shamed, reputation dragged through the dirt. I'm not getting that promotion anytime soon.</p> <p>On my first day in the town, I get caught up in a strange murder case, and Death saves my life. Yes, the Death. The delectable, mysterious Death.</p> <p>Goodness, he is hotness personified. But what happened to make him walk away from his responsibilities? And why is he so deliciously tempting, my desire a raging inferno every time he looks at me with those incredible eyes? I shouldn't be thinking of an immortal being like this, but with every passing hour I can't stop myself from falling deeper into infatuation.</p> <p>I want him.</p> <p>Resistance is . . . impossible.</p>";
