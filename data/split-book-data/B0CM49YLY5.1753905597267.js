He was left stranded in the middle of a monster-infested forest, nobody to rely on but himself as he fights to build strength.</p> <p>And his time magic wasn't given to him freely.</p> <p>He stole it.</p> <p>And its original owners would go to any lengths to take it back.</p> <p>Don't miss the start of a new LitRPG adventure filled with time magic, three-dimensional characters, a crunchy LitRPG system, tactical combat, and power progression where level-ups are hard-earned and bring with them meaningful change in characters’ abilities.</p>";
