Because of his mother’s nomadic lifestyle, he’s never had a best friend, never kissed a girl, and he’s certainly never met anyone like Cassandra Larsson - the enigmatic, older girl whose idea of fun blurs the line between right and wrong.</p> <p>Being hopelessly led by emotions he’s never felt, Baker finds himself plodding along dark paths paved by the girl he thinks he may love - a road to self-destruction, where vigilante justice is encouraged and bloodshed is an art form.</p>";
