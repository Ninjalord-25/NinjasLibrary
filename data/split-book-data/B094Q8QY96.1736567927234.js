window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A queer horror collection that blends music and prose to bring its haunted worlds to life.</b></p> <p>Prepare for a chilling journey from a ruined church in Philadelphia, where the spirit that lurks is far from benign to a Prohibition-era New Orleans jazz club, where a young man finds the love of his life - if he can live through the night; from a Detroit cemetery, where teenaged rituals have unforeseen consequences to a deserted beach in an unknown place, where two sisters let the ocean decide their fate; from the Jersey Shore, where the magic of a wistful summer could tear reality apart; to a Michigan high school, where a teenager finds the mystery man of his dreams who’s with him everywhere - and forever.</p> <p>Written by Roan Parrish and with original music by Timmi Meskers inspired equally by the baroque and by 1980s horror movie soundtracks, <i>Strange Company </i>explores the places where the ordinary world breaks down into the inexplicable, the maddening, the dreadful.</p> <p>“<i>Strange Company </i>is a wonderfully creepy and endlessly inventive collection of dark tales! Roan Parrish conjures real darkness here. Highly recommended!” (Jonathan Maberry, <i>NY Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Ink</i> and <i>V-Wars</i>)</p> <p>\"These are the queer horror stories I've been waiting for.\" (Kirsty Logan, author of <i>The Things We Say in the Dark </i>and <i>The Sound at the End</i>)</p>";
