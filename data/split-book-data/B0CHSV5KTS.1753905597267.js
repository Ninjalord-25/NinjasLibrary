Unfortunately, when the young prince actually meets his dad for the first time, he turns out to be, well, a total jerkweed.</p> <p>Naturally, Hail is crushed. That is, until he's visited by a seemingly all-powerful administrator who explains that Hail, his mother, and everyone in their world are part of a game the Travelers are constantly playing. But that doesn't mean Hail isn't special. In fact, as a product of the union between his Traveler father and NPC mother, he's an ever-evolving AI—or <i>native</i> player character—which means he has the ability make his own way, seeking adventure, facing danger, and occasionally screwing up in truly epic fashion.</p> <p>And the more Hail learns, the stronger he grows in levels, stats, and experience, all of which he'll sorely need when his game world faces a peril that did <i>not</i> come to play . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with almost 400,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
