window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Bible is often presented as an antiquated document filled with mysterious prophesies, unbelievable fables, and arbitrary decisions by a God whose actions range from anger and vengeance to love and forgiveness. The Bible's creation story appears to be at complete odds with more credible scientific explanations of the origins and evolution of life, and believers in Biblical truth are further challenged by haunting questions about why a good God would create a world so full of evil, pain, suffering, and death. <i>Satan's Dare</i> takes these issues and questions head-on.</p>";
