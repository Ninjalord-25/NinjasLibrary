Between the six pack abs and the extreme hangover, he can't decide if last night was a good thing or...something else.</p> <p>Hayden quickly discovers that, if left unchecked, this thirst could end up killing him, but only if he fails to find the woman who turned him.</p> <p>What's more, there's something unique about him, even among the vampires.
