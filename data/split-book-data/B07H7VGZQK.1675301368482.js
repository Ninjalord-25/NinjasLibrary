A fast-paced, convincing thriller set in an unusual locale.\" (<i>Baltimore Sun</i>)</p> <p>\"Plot twists and turns that chart a tricky course through the deep waters of human need and greed.\" (<i>Ocala Star-Banner</i>)</p> <p>“Local atmosphere and a good knowledge of treacherous currents keep things on course.” (<i>The London Times</i>)</p> <p>On a moonless night in 1945, a destroyer sinks a U-boat, 50 miles off Hatteras Island, the graveyard of the Atlantic. Over a half-century later, the mummified corpses of three crewmen, wrapped in a decaying rubber raft, come to light during excavation for a new shopping development. Their reappearance unleashes neo-Nazis, drug smugglers, and a shadowy \"historian\" with an ominous plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Hatteras native, salvage diver, and ex-con Lyle \"Tiller\" Galloway III starts digging into the discovery, he's forced by an island family to take on a dangerous silent partner. Together, he and Shadrach Aydlett will discover what actually happened in the Carolina sand hills so long ago, and what everyone's really after...tons of long-lost Nazi gold. And finally, he’ll battle a ruthless killer many fathoms beneath the stormy sea off Cape Hatteras.&nbsp;</p>";
