It has been the bane of her existence, as it disrupts her life and the lives of those around her when supervillains come knocking, wanting to prove their mettle by fighting the Chosen One. Nobody listens when she insists she isn't who they think she is.&nbsp;</p> <p>With common sense and years of rage built up inside, she usually serves their butts to them on a platter, asking, \"Did you want fries with that?\"&nbsp;</p> <p>No cape required.</p>";
