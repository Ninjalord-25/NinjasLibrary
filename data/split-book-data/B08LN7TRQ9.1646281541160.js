window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is a typical holiday season at chaotic Chicago O’Hare when a few members of the large Alexander family waited to board flights - one to South Carolina and the other to Washington, DC. At the same time, a member of the Montgomery clan from the Pennsylvania mountains also waited for a delayed flight. Little did either family know or suspect, the effects from this first meeting would last forever.</p> <p>Family is everything to the Alexanders and the Montgomerys. Although they both come from farm backgrounds, they didn’t know each other or the histories involved. However, these two divergent clans would come together and change the lives of so many - and maybe even the world. As their lives play out and intertwine in surprising ways, they face a challenging future and marshal their forces to work for the better good of all.</p>";
