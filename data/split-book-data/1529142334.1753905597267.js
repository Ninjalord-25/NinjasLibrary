window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All 18 episodes of the BBC radio sitcom about a 30-something barmaid living on a tiny Scottish island. </b></p> <p>Irene Bruce spends her days pulling pints in Millport, the only town on the Isle of Cumbrae, a few miles off the west coast of Scotland. Frustrated and going nowhere fast, she yearns to escape to the mainland for a better life - or at least a bit of fun. Just over the water, there are clubs, cinemas and discos, so why is she stuck at home with tea, Scrabble and her boring sister, Moira?</p> <p>In these three series, Irene tries her hand at matchmaking, celebrates her 33rd birthday, faces a dilemma over a talking dog and finds romance where she least expects it. And as Cumbrae is beset by strange events and emergencies - from a missing pensioner, to a threat to the local pub, to a media makeover that risks ruining the island's integrity - she keeps trying to leave town, and keeps being pulled back. But when push finally comes to shove, she's forced to consider where her heart really lies: on the mainland, or in Millport.... </p> <p>Written by and starring Lynn Ferguson (<i>No Angels</i>, <i>Chicken Run</i>) as Irene, this bittersweet comedy drama boasts an all-Scottish cast and a panoply of vibrant, eccentric characters. Comedian and impressionist Janet Brown plays Moira, with Lewis MacLeod (<i>Dead Ringers</i>,<i> Spitting Image</i>) as caf√© owner Alberto and Robert the dog.</p> <p><b>Production credits</b></p> <p>Written by Lynn Ferguson</p> <p>Produced by Lucy Bacon</p> <p>Music for series two and three arranged by Olly Fox</p> <p>First broadcast BBC Radio 4, 22 March-26 April 2000 (series one), 27 April-1 June 2001 (series two), 1 November-6 December 2002 (series three)</p> <p><b>Cast</b></p> <p>Irene - Lynn Ferguson</p> <p>Moira/Agnes - Janet Brown</p> <p>Alberto/Robert the dog/Derek/Dieter/Ferryman/Dr Hume/Inspector/Morris/Mr</p> <p>Shetland/Mr Skye - Lewis MacLeod</p> <p>Ena/Bunty/Betty/Diane/Fiona - Gabriel Quigley</p> <p>Dougie - Matt Costello/Kenneth Bryans</p> <p>DJ/Gordon/Minister/Lucian Highburgh-Conner/Mr Dunoon/Mr Orkney- Robert Paterson</p> <p>Huberto/Mr Arran - Kenneth Bryans</p> <p>Bob - Lewis MacLeod/Robert Paterson</p>";
