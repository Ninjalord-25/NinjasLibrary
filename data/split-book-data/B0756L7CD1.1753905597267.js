His face, disfigured from a childhood accident, seemed to confirm he was the monster the community hoped to banish. With Paul in prison, the killings stopped. </p> <p>For 17 years, Haven was peaceful again. But Paul served his time and has now returned to Haven - the town where he grew up, and the scene of his alleged crimes. Paul insists he didn't commit those crimes, and several townspeople believe him including the local priest, a young boy named Denny, and his best friend Billy. </p> <p>Trouble is, now that Paul is back home, the bizarre killings have started again - and the patterns match the deaths from Haven's past. If Paul isn't the killer, who is? </p> <p>Or what is? An unlikely band of adventurers attempts to uncover the truth, delving into long-hidden tunnels that might actually be inhabited by a strange, predatory creature. </p> <p>Haven is a compelling horror epic in the spirit of <i>It</i> or <i>Summer of Night</i>, and a stunning debut novel from a gifted author who knows that the darkest horrors lurk inside human beings, even when there is a monster on the loose. </p>";
