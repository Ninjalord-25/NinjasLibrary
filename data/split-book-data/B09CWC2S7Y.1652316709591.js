window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The land of Condel is blessed, and Gaernod is not. Eofyn is king, and Spyre most certainly isn’t. When Spyre’s king threatens Eofyn’s kingdom and the source of its people’s power, Spyre sets out on a journey to save the Blessed Kingdom, not because he wants to, but because the other creatures of Curnen have threatened to kill him if he doesn't. It’s a long road ahead to save a kingdom he’s sure will hate him, and he’ll have to brave the many realms of Curnen to reach Condel and, regrettably, beyond to do it.</p> <p>The Fyre is going out, and the crystals are fading. The dragons are coming, and the king has fled. Only one thing is certain: Spyre did not sign up for this.</p>";
