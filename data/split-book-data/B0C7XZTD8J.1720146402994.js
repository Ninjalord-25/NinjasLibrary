window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A brilliant investigation into the motivations and methods behind the actions of Hogwarts's renowned Headmaster!</p> <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, is one of the most recognizable and mysterious figures in the Harry Potter series. As an unscrupulous beetle-like journalist once said, he's \"a biographer's dream.\" Is he omniscient or limited? Is he benevolent or malevolent? What really drove him in the last years of an extraordinary life?</p> <p>Dumbledore dives between the lines of the Harry Potter books to create a portrait of the controversial Headmaster. We find Dumbledore's hand in every seeming coincidence and consider the impossible decisions he had to make. This in-depth examination from author Irvin Khaytman casts the events of the Harry Potter series in a whole new light, resolving fans' questions that linger to this day.</p>";
