Shadow must rush to stop him before he obtains an ancient magic and reigns over The City unchallenged.</p> <p>When tensions deepen during her mission to kill or be killed, Shadow must face the past she's been hiding from and the deadly enemies who hunt her, including a vengeful princess turned soldier, a Commander with a painful past, and a traitor that leaves her barely clinging to her life. And worst of all, she may need their help to succeed.</p> <p>As war brews inside the Great City's walls, only one thing is certain: They will come to know the monsters within.</p>";
