Why is our boss keeping this case off the books? Why is our top suspect, the most notorious rogue in Vancouver, mired in contradictions? And why am I the only one who cares more about the victim than their own ulterior motives?</p> <p>Everyone wants me to shut up and follow orders, but that's not my style. I'll do whatever it takes to save this kid - even if that means returning to my roguish roots.</p>";
