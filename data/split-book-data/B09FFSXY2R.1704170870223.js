window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>With his heart’s desire at stake, can he resist giving Fate a little nudge?</i></b></p> <p>Half-norn event planner Anders Skuldsson is under strict orders from Asgard not to meddle with Fate. But with Enchanted Occasions’ latest booking - the competition for the hand of Faerie’s one true prince - crashing around his ears, it’s really, really, <i>really</i> difficult to toe that particular line. So...if Andy just <i>happens</i> to pose as a contender for the prince? It’s an <i>emergency</i>, damn it. Besides, it’s only temporary, so Odin can hardly blame him. Right?</p> <p>If Conall of Odstone hadn’t sworn a blood oath to protect his half-brother, Prince Reyner, he’d murder the idiot himself. Rey was supposed to be here, choosing a mate before being crowned and wed. Instead, he’s disappeared, leaving Con to impersonate him. Again.</p> <p>But when Con meets Andy, his anger turns to desire...and despair. Even if Andy forgives him for pretending to be someone he’s not, how could a man as appealing and accomplished as Andy - a man who’s eligible for a prince’s hand, for pity’s sake - settle for the court outcast?</p> <p>As for Andy, his burgeoning feelings for the prince are both unfortunate and hopeless because <i>hello</i>? Half-norn? Faerie prince? Not exactly a match made in Valhalla.</p> <p>When the Faerie Queen herself hands down an ultimatum, the double deception isn’t their only obstacle. Unless Andy makes the right decision, both their fates could be sealed by...well.... Fate.</p> <p><i>Nudging Fate</i> is a 54,000-word paranormal rom-com featuring mistaken identity, royalty in disguise, interfering coworkers, an iron knight with a soft heart, a temperamental goblin chef, and a guaranteed HEA.</p>";
