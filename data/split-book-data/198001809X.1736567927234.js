When Isoka's magic is discovered by the government, she's arrested and brought to the Emperor's spymaster, who sends her on an impossible mission: Steal <i>Soliton</i>, a legendary ghost ship - a ship from which no one has ever returned. If she fails, her sisterâ€™s life is forfeit.</p> <p>On board <i>Soliton</i>, nothing is as simple as it seems.
