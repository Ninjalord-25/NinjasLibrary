This story details my meeting with the first fan that asked me to autograph a paperback version of Deadly Reality TV Series book <i>Number One Easy Money</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dedicated to Marcy (even though I changed your name, you know who you are).&nbsp;</p> <p>In my experience, it wasn't the fan that became obsessed with me. I became obsessed with her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite this book being inspired by true events, it is still a tale of blood of gore.&nbsp;</p> <p>Listener beware: Don't let the title fool you...this is extreme horror.</p>";
