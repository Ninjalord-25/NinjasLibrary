window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Book one in the Pete, Drinker of Blood series!</b></p> <p>Hollywood resident Pete Tyler is used to wanting what he shouldn't have - human blood - and what he can't have - a juicy cheeseburger, or the gorgeous Angie who serves those burgers down at the Starbucket on the Sunset Strip. He’s become comfortable with the lonely but predictable way he's survived since he died in 1973, when vampire lord Carson Fitzgerald turned him.</p> <p>Now, however, Fitzgerald has returned to Los Angeles, and is demanding his children tend to his needs in a rather unpleasant way. To get the girl and remain unliving, Pete’s gonna have to take the fight to Fitzgerald by joining forces with the prissy Hollywood vampires who have always annoyed the hell out of him - and that's when the sh*t is gonna hit the fangs!</p> <p>A fun listen for fans of humorous urban fantasy.</p> <p>If you dig Mercy Thompson, Harry Dresden, or Sandman Slim, and are looking for a fun new series, check out Pete! Titles include <i>Doorchick of Darkness</i>, <i>Pete Has Risen from the Grave</i>, <i>Taste the Blood of Pete</i>, <i>The Room-Temperature Warrior</i>, and more coming soon!</p> <p><b>From the author:</b> I’m a big fan of classic bloodsucking vampires including B-movie vampires, but I also enjoy humorous looks at what it would be like to be an \"everyday\" vampire, like in <i>What We Do in the Shadows</i>. How does a vampire without a big spooky castle just get through the day - uh, night? That's what l like to explore in the Pete books.</p> <p>After working in a video store for years and then running my own video store for more years, I've seen thousands of b-movies and written reviews for many of them, which led to my review collection <i>Unsafe on Any Screen</i>. Working in filmmaking in both the Hollywood and indie worlds influenced my novel<i> Squirrel Eyes</i>. I've met a lot of vampires during all of this, and it got me thinking about what it would be like to be an average guy who just happened to be a vampire.</p>";
