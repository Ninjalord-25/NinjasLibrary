It’s in her blood.</p> <p>She’s supposed to eat children, blast people with witchfire, and plot dark deeds with her foul-mouthed imp familiar, Jizzimus. Instead, she’s rescued a girl, Kay, from a band of people traffickers. To keep her safe they have signed up for a college course in an English country mansion. Jizzimus is not impressed.</p> <p>The mansion is not the safe haven they thought it would be. They say they want to turn good witches into great witches, but witches are going missing, there are far more ghosts round here than there ought to be and there is something huge and terrible in the woods.</p> <p>If Jenny thought that messing up her witchcraft coursework and getting distracted by the handsome gardener was going to be the worst of her problems, she’s dead wrong.</p> <p>With new witch friends, sexy mind-controller Caroline and soft-hearted herbalist Dee, Jenny’s determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. It turns out that at Effie Fray’s training college you have to learn fast or die trying.</p> <p>You’ll love this fun-loving witch academy audiobook because sometimes it needs friends to show us how to be a better version of ourselves.</p>";
