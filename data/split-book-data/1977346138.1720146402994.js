window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The long-awaited translation of the novel behind the cult classic Japanese movie.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>In this gloriously over-the-top tale, Aoyama, a widower who has lived alone with his son ever since his wife died seven years before, finally decides it is time to remarry. Since Aoyama is a bit rusty when it comes to dating, a filmmaker friend proposes that, in order to attract the perfect wife, they do a casting call for a movie they don't intend to produce. As the resumes pile up, only one of the applicants catches Aoyama's attention - Yamasaki Asami - a striking young former ballerina with a mysterious past. Blinded by his instant and total infatuation, Aoyama is too late in discovering that she is a far cry from the innocent young woman he imagines her to be. The novel's fast-paced, thriller conclusion doesn't spare the listener as Yamasaki takes off her angelic mask and reveals what lies beneath.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>Contains mature themes.</i></b></p>";
