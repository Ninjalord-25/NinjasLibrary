window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Just one sip of ale leaves Hawkin with a life-changing decision.</b></p> <p>Isolated in the northern wilderness, Hawkin—an adventurer turned hermit—is fulfilled by the small joys of his simple life. He hunts and forages for food, tends to a small garden, maintains his humble cabin, and patrols the meandering trail that leads down to the sea.</p> <p>After celebrating ten years alone in his woods, visitors begin to arrive. First an ancient monster, then a trio of monks with a peculiar set of skills. When the monks share their flagship ale with Hawkin, a transcendent experience leaves him with a choice: engage with the system screen he'd gladly disabled long ago, or pass on the chance to brew magic beer. Unable to forget the wondrous ale he tasted, Hawkin accepts the Brewer’s path.</p> <p>The MC of this cozy, slice of life fantasy is an in-world character. He follows a quest path that allows him to level up on his own terms by picking the quests he is willing to take, and ignoring the rest. Along his crafting journey, Hawkin is joined by an OP monster with an insatiable appetite, a talkative goblin with a deep love of onions, and a blue, squirrel-like creature that's always in the mood to shoot dice. An interest in real-world beer brewing isn't necessary to follow the story or Hawkin’s progression.</p>";
