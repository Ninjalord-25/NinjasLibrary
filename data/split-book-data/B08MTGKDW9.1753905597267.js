It seems like a perfect place to relax and get close to nature. But not everything in Crimson Cove is natural. </p> <p>When Cade Colter moves to town, he expects it to be peaceful to the point of boredom. But he quickly learns that after the sun sets and the fog rolls in, the little tourist town takes on a whole new kind of life - and death. </p> <p><b>Darkness at the edge of town: </b>Renowned for its wild parties and history of debauchery, The Crimson Corset looms on the edge of town, inviting patrons to sate their most depraved desires and slake their darkest thirsts. </p> <p>Proprietor Gretchen VanTreese has waited centuries to annihilate the Old World vampires on the other side of town and create a new race - a race that she alone will rule. When she realizes Cade Colter has the key that will unlock her plan, she begins laying an elaborate trap that will put everyone around him in mortal danger.</p> <p><b>Blood wars: </b>The streets are running red with blood, and as violence and murder ravage the night, Cade must face the darkest forces inside himself and, perhaps, even abandon his own humanity in order to protect what he loves.</p> <p>“Put Bram Stoker in a giant cocktail shaker, add a pinch of Laurell K. Hamilton, a shot of John Carpenter, and a healthy jigger of absinthe, and you’ll end up with Alistair Cross’s modern Gothic chiller <i>The Crimson Corset </i>- a deliciously terrifying tale that will sink its teeth into you from page one.” (Jay Bonansinga, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Walking Dead: Invasion</i> and <i>Lucid</i>)</p> <p>“This drop-deadly tale of seduction and terror will leave you begging to be fanged... ” (Tamara Thorne, international best-selling author of <i>Haunted</i> and <i>Moonfall</i>)</p> <p>“I couldn’t put this book down. It’s got more hooks than a day boat out of San Pedro Harbor!” (QL Pearce, author)</p>";
