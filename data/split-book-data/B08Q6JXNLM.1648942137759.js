window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Every curse must have an end.</p> <p>Belinda Lambton knows a curse when she sees one. She also knows the wisdom of agreeing with a powerful enchantress. So when she inadvertently gets mixed up with a cursed Beast and his enchantress, she finds herself tasked with the role of Curse Breaker. That’s not an easy position, for Beast has reasons of his own to keep his curse. There’s also someone else determined to break it by whatever means possible and claim Beast for herself, and she doesn’t take competition well.&nbsp;</p> <p>With wit, clean romance, and a touch of danger, <i>Midnight for a Curse</i> is a retelling of the beloved Beauty and the Beast tale.</p>";
