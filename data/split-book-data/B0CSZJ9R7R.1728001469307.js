window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>James Sutton was an average guy—he couldn’t afford college and didn’t really know what he wanted to do with his life. <br> <br> But when his sister Holly goes missing, he finds out he’s been living in an urban fantasy: An alien really did land in Roswell in the 1940s…and the US has had a secret alliance with them ever since.<br> <br> They are symbiotes—capable of bonding with hosts, enhancing their strength, agility, and stamina. The only problem is, finding a viable host is difficult, until the symbiotes discover Humanity. <br> <br> Now mankind finds itself in the middle of an alien civil war between two symbiote factions—those who would be our allies…and those who would subjugate us into slavery.</p>";
