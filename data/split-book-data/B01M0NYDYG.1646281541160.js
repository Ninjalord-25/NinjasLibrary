window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of The Event Group series launches a new series of paranormal thrillers just in time for Halloween. </p> <p>Built at the turn of the 20th century by one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, tucked away in the pristine Pocono Mountains, Summer Place, a retreat for the rich and famous, seems the very essence of charm and beauty, \"a scene borrowed from a wondrous fairy tale of gingerbread houses, bright forests, and glowing, sunny meadows\". But behind the yellow and white-trimmed exterior lurks an evil waiting to devour the unwary. </p> <p>Seven years ago Professor Gabriel Kennedy's investigation into paranormal activity at Summer Place ended in tragedy and destroyed his career. Now Kelly Delaphoy, the ambitious producer of a top-rated ghost-hunting television series, is determined to make Summer Place the centerpiece of an epic live broadcast on Halloween night. To ensure success she needs help from the one man who has come face-to-face with the evil that dwells in Summer Place, a man still haunted by the ghosts of his own failure. Disgraced and alienated from the academic community, Kennedy wants nothing to do with the event. But Summer Place has other plans. </p> <p>As Summer Place grows stronger, Kennedy, along with the paranormal ghost hunting team, The Supernaturals, sets out to confront and, if possible, destroy the evil presence dwelling there. </p>";
