Now if only he would stop being ambushed by assassins afterward—it's definitely becoming quite annoying.</p> <p>Uncle Steve's campaign is still a thing, and he might have to put in another appearance with Black and White before it's over, but right now, he's become intrigued by a rumor that seems to be circulating around the djevels. Something about a new djevel prince. One that has not only learned to survive here in this new world but one who's learned to thrive in it. A certain incubus lord who apparently happens to be&nbsp;<i>him</i>.</p> <p>For Mihalis, and the lions, this could be something of a game changer. Dealing with the djevels has been proving to be more difficult than first imagined—they're a lot craftier and more cunning than originally thought. If Mihalis were to encourage this idea, it could be helpful. However, there's a possible downside to this whole affair as well. To be a djevel prince, Mihalis would have to take their oaths, and taking their oaths ties him directly into&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;power pool.</p> <p>No one knows just what the effects of Mihalis touching that would be...</p> <p>WARNING: Under the advice of council, I'm not supposed to talk about -REDACTED- or -REDACTED- and how the initial trials of -REDACTED- with his new -REDACTED- performed. However, I can tell you that <i>Beware of Darkness</i> does contain more of the -REDACTED- that you've come to -REDACTED-. So, remember that! And don't say you weren't warned! (Note: No -REDACTED- were -REDACTED-, -REDACTED- chandelier -REDACTED-)</p>";
