Crossing it was considered suicide, and he'd never given much thought to what might lay beyond. Then, his life collapsed around him.<br> Ejected from the military academy that was to have marked the start of his career, disowned by his family, passed over by the gods themselves, Viggo's last chance lay beyond the veil.<br> Yet, from the very beginning, something was deeply troubling about the realm from whence the gods came. Its cities lay in ruins, its lands peopled by lunatics locked into tasks they could not escape. Even the natural laws were corrupted, and death itself had lost its grip.<br> Viggo's access to the strange, seemingly omnipotent system gave him new abilities and limitless potential. With a reincarnated goddess and a strange fox-woman for companions, Viggo quickly realized that to survive in this world would be easy: he was immortal. The hard part would be keeping his sanity.<br> The road he must travel will lead to conflict with champions and the gods they serve, but before that, he has to learn to live in a world that won't let him die.</p>";
