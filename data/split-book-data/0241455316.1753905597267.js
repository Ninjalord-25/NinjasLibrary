This definitive recording includes an introduction by Michael Newton. </b></p> <p>'<i>The ghost is the most enduring figure in supernatural fiction. He is absolutely indestructible.

(Dorothy Scarborough)</p> <p>This new selection of ghost stories, by Michael Newton, brings together the best of the genre. From Elizabeth Gaskell's 'The Old Nurse's Story<i>'</i> through to Edith Wharton's 'Afterword<i>'</i>, this collection covers all of the most terrifying tales of the genre.
