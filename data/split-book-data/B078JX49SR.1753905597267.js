A devastating but essential read.” (Kevin Powers, best-selling author and National Book Award finalist for The Yellow Birds) </p> <p>From the rubble-strewn streets of U.S.-occupied Baghdad, Hadi — a scavenger and an oddball fixture at a local café — collects human body parts and stitches them together to create a corpse. His goal, he claims, is for the government to recognize the parts as people and to give them proper burial. </p> <p>But when the corpse goes missing, a wave of eerie murders sweeps the city, and reports stream in of a horrendous-looking criminal who, though shot, cannot be killed. Hadi soon realizes he’s created a monster, one that needs human flesh to survive — first from the guilty, and then from anyone in its path. </p> <p>A prizewinning novel by “Baghdad’s new literary star” (<i>The New York Times</i>), Frankenstein in Baghdad captures with white-knuckle horror and black humor the surreal reality of contemporary Iraq. </p>";
