Turns out that Rowan had been given something most street rats can only dream ofâ€”a second chance.</p> <p>With only a sword, a spell book, and enough gold for tuition, he is thrust into a school for aspiring adventurers. A world full of haughty nobles, scions of wealthy families, and various other types of people he used to steal from.</p> <p>Here, Rowan must vie for his place among students who have been diving in their family-owned dungeons for years, their bodies filled with dense mana instead of tavern scraps and the occasional pilfered apple pie. He will have to fight, study, and keep his true past a secret.</p> <p>Because Faebrook Academy is his second chance. His last chance.</p> <p>About the series: Follow Rowan, a lowly street rat, on his journey to becoming a legendary adventurer in a world where diving monster-filled dungeons infuses your body with mana and helps you climb from lowly bronze tier all the way to the fabled platinum tier. But first, he has to graduate.</p>";
