window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>This program includes a preface read by the author. </i></p> <p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Laurie R. King comes the book that introduced us to the ingenious Mary Russell - Sherlock Holmes mysteries.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1915, Sherlock Holmes is retired and quietly engaged in the study of honeybees when a young woman literally stumbles into him on the Sussex Downs. Fifteen years old, gawky, egotistical, and recently orphaned, the young Mary Russell displays an intellect to impress even Sherlock Holmes - and match him wit for wit. Under his reluctant tutelage, this very modern 20th-century woman proves a deft protégée and a fitting partner for the Victorian detective.&nbsp;</p> <p>In their first case together, they must track down a kidnapped American senator's daughter and confront a truly cunning adversary: a bomber who has set trip wires for the sleuths and who will stop at nothing to end their partnership.&nbsp;</p> <p>Full of brilliant deductions, disguises, and dangers, this first book of the Mary Russell - Sherlock Holmes mysteries is \"wonderfully original and entertaining...absorbing from beginning to end.\" (<i>Booklist</i>). Named \"One of the Century's Best 100 Mysteries\" by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association.</p>";
