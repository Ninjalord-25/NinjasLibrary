Some of these dark magi vanished before capture.</p> <p>The world of Pravahs suffered from a time of darkness and genocide at their hands. These demon-instructed magi turned the skies black, led an army of the living dead and demons in a global conquest, and left miles of burned earth in their hellfire assaults. Their defeat was nothing short of miraculous.</p> <p>While the land remembers, people forget.</p> <p>The people of the continent of Stratia have dismissed the ancient \"Black Decade\" as myth, even while their blood runs cold with fear at the mention of the dreaded \"Void Hands\".</p> <p>But the people of the nation of Malkanor are more concerned with foraging for their next meal, or if their hovels will stand against the next storm. Their dying cries and anguish are silenced by the merciless nobility.</p> <p>A change comes!</p> <p>Rylin unleashes an innate raw power to save the life of his best friend, Ishell. This is noticed by the Order of the Enlightened Sun, an order of united magi who serve all Stratia.</p> <p>For the two friends, a time of discovery and transformation is about to begin.

After centuries of slumber, they will rise and gather their dark powers. They will continue in their objective…the annihilation of everything!</p>";
