When a local recluse, Ned Crosby, hits what is believed to be a large bear with his car, people soon start disappearing. After a stranger from Montana mysteriously shows up with theories of his own, Sheriff Ross Pickett is faced with a disturbing premonition that something evil might be lurking about. Afraid to confide in those who are closest to him for fear of being ridiculed, Pickett must battle his own inner demons and confront his destiny within the confines of the Amen.</p>";
