window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As they fight a war of good and evil in our world, the Fairy Tales need a protector.</b></p> <p>All I wanted to do was take a break from college to check out LegendFest, some good ol' cosplay, and maybe find a lady to hit it off with. You never know, right?</p> <p>My life took a new direction, though, when I found out myths like Red Riding Hood are real, and theyâ€™re in an ongoing war against evil to save us all. More than that, they are being hunted, mistaken as humanity's enemy. They need a mortal to serve as their protector, someone to keep them out of harm's way while leading the battle against the likes of the Big Bad Wolf, Baba Yaga, and other evil legends.</p> <p>Now, I am that protector.</p> <p>It's a tough job, but it's everything I've ever dreamed of. Even more so when Red and some of the other ladies show interest in me in more ways than just my ability to wield a magic blade.</p> <p><i>Note: It gets saucy. We have fun on the streets and even more in the sheets, so you might not want to hear my tale if sexy fun scares you more than witches and ghouls. If you're a fan of </i><b><i>Once Upon a Time </i></b><i>or </i><b><i>Fables/Wolf Among Us</i></b><i> but also enjoy harem and the spice of life, this book's for you.</i></p>";
