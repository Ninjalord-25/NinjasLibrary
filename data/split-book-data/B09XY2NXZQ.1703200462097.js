window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It's lasagna time!</b></p> <p>After successfully ranking up together with the rest of the Happy Sunflowers, Arek and his party are ready to kick back and enjoy some much needed relaxation. However, they can't can't seem to stay out of trouble for long. After mistakenly angering a ruthless guild, they are forced to flee Riverfall.</p> <p>They set off for Red Mount, hoping to wait out the storm, but an even greater threat lies in wait for them. Arek's old life threatens to spill out into his new one as the magical runes he had destroyed slowly gain power once more, but he's determined to keep cooking for those in need—even if it costs him everything.</p> <p><b>Book two in the Morcster Chef series is here. Join Arek on another adventure against unexpected enemies&nbsp;and burnt crust.</b></p> <p><b>About the series: </b>A fantasy/LitRPG lite series with a unique cooking twist. It contains status windows and other RPG elements, but it is not set within a video game. It will appeal to anyone that enjoys a slice-of-life fantasy about a group of adventurers as well as fans of <i>Food Wars!</i></p> <p><i>This novel also contains real recipes, and we highly recommend you give them a taste if you're hungry!</i></p>";
