window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Kolchak Papers: The Original Novels</i> by Jeff Rice </b></p> <p>In 1972, Jeff Rice's novel <i>The Night Stalker</i> introduced Carl Kolchak to the world. This spine-tingling novel of supernatural terror became an instant best seller and served as the basis for the film of the same name. After <i>The Night Stalker</i> became one of the highest rated television movies of all time, a sequel, <i>The Night Strangler</i>, was released the following year to great acclaim. Now, after more than three decades out of print, <i>The Night Stalker</i> and <i>The Night Strangler</i> are together in one volume. </p> <p><b><i>Cry of Thunder: Sherlock Holmes &amp; Kolchak the Night Stalker</i> by Joe Gentile </b></p> <p>Two of the most unique investigators of all time try to untangle the same mystery, 100 years apart from each other. Set in the lawless Wild West, the hidden world of Victorian London, and the present-day hell of Hollywood, <i>Cry of Thunder: Sherlock Holmes &amp; Kolchak the Night Stalker</i> follows Holmes' trail of a man who was wrongfully - and willingly - imprisoned; a shocking New World Order anarchy; a beautiful woman who needs Kolchak to delve into the surreal past; and the shunned man who holds the key. </p> <p><b><i>Kolchak and the Lost World</i> by C. J. Henderson </b></p> <p>After convincing a serial killer to confess, newspaper reporter Kolchak is offered an international assignment with massive coverage around the world. With fame and fortune finally within reach, he's ready to cover the story - until he's confronted by a mysterious monk who warns him that \"the 72 must always be\". What this means is not explained. But before he knows it, Kolchak's dreams are invaded by inexplicable images warning him that every step he takes toward the big story is bringing him closer to death. </p>";
