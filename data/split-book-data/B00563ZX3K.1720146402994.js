window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Southwest Arizona, a century ago: an uneasy truce exists between the remote frontier community of Picture City and the neighboring Apaches.&nbsp;That delicate peace is shredded when the bodies of two white men are found hideously mutilated.&nbsp;The angry townspeople are certain the “savages” have broken the treaty, but Billjohn Finley, the local Indian agent, fears that darker, more unholy forces may be at work.&nbsp;There’s a tall, dark stranger in town, who rode in wearing the dead men’s clothes. A stranger who may not be entirely human. </p> <p>Originally published as a mass-market Western in 1994, <i>Shadow on the Sun</i> has been largely overlooked by horror fans and general readers.&nbsp;But this tale of supernatural terror is sure to chill the blood of Matheson’s many fans.</p>";
