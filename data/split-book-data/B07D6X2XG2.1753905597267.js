In idyllic Adams County, home of the Bell family, there exists a collection of tight-knit rural communities with deeply held beliefs. And even more deeply buried secrets. </p> <p>Jack and Lucy Bell operate a prosperous family farm northwest of Nashville, where life with their many children is peaceful. Simple country life. That is until those secrets take on a life of their own and refuse to remain unspoken. </p> <p>Much has been written about the legend of the Bell Witch of Tennessee, but the details of the Bell family's terrifying experience with the supernatural have never been told in quite the way that Bram Stoker Award-nominated horror author John F.D. Taff has conceived. </p> <p>In his novel, for the first time, the Witch has her own say. And what she reveals about the incident and the dark motivations behind her appearance reaches way beyond a traditional haunting. Forget what you've heard about this wholly American legend. What you believe you know about the mysterious occurrences on the Bell farm is wrong. Uncover the long-hidden reality that's far more horrifying than any ghost story you've ever heard.</p>";
