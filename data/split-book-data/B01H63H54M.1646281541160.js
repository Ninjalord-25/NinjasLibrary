Hall, Paul Giamatti, Will Patton, Norbert Leo Butz, Lois Smith, Dylan Baker, Kyle Beltran, Dana Ivey, Robert Petkoff, David Morse, and Frances Sternhagen.</b> </p> <p>The master at his scarifying best! From heart-pounding terror to the eeriest of whimsy - tales from the outer limits of one of the greatest imaginations of our time! </p> <p>In \"The Mist\", a supermarket becomes the last bastion of humanity as a peril beyond dimension invades the earth. </p> <p>Touch \"The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands\", and say your prayers. </p> <p>There are some things in attics that are better left alone - things like \"The Monkey\". </p> <p>The most sublime woman driver on earth offers a man \"Mrs. Todd's Shortcut\" to paradise. </p> <p>A boy's sanity is pushed to the edge when he's left alone with the odious corpse of \"Gramma\". </p> <p>If you were stunned by <i>Gremlins</i>, the Fornits of \"The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet\" will knock your socks off. </p> <p>Trucks that punish and beautiful teen demons who seduce a young man to massacre; curses whose malevolence grows through the years; obscene presences and angels of grace - here, indeed, is a night-blooming bouquet of chills and thrills. </p>";
