A dragon child that smiles, laughs, knows a few words, and is the source for all magic on Earth. So long as he has Matty - Astrid's mom, and the love of his very long life - everything will be okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>So they're gonna party with the trolls, who celebrate Matty's distant troll lineage like she's one of their own, and you best believe they celebrate the dragon child that shares a tiny bit of their blood, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But not all trolls are happy with their situation beneath the Jotunheimen Mountains in Norway. Some of the ancient monsters want change; some hate it. All are nervous, and excited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But some forces in the caverns of Ygg'rasgard want change that requires blood to be spilled and for a little girl to be taken from her mother and father.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>And deeper still, other forgotten forces stir.</p>";
