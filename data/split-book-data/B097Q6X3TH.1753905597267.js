Mallory</b></p> <p><b>A Haven Hollow novel</b></p> <p>Welcome to Haven Hollow, a town of monsters....</p> <p>After dating a string of losers and banishing a poltergeist, I packed up my Los Angeles life and my 11-year-old son, and moved...to a town in Oregon with a population of 680. Well, 682 now.</p> <p>Culture shock anyone? Ahem, never mind that.... New starts can happen anywhere, right?</p> <p>I hope so, because I need to start the next chapter of my 43-year life pronto. So, why Haven Hollow? For one reason - there aren’t any witches here. And a witch can make a gypsy’s life...complicated.</p> <p>Oh, right, I’ve put the cart before the horse....</p> <p>Hi, I’m Poppy Morton, and I come from a long line of Scottish gypsies - gypsies who possess magic and make potions to treat any and all ailments. It’s been my dream to open my own potions store and I’m finally going to do it - in the picturesque and small town of Haven Hollow.</p> <p>Once my son, Finn, and I get settled in our two-story ramshackle, decrepit and rickety farmhouse (that happens to be bordering a cemetery), the nightmares start. And they won’t stop. Almost every night, I find myself face to face with a shadow monster - and its victim. And I’m fairly sure it’s the victim sending me the night terrors, wanting me to figure out the mystery of who or what murdered him.</p> <p>But, I’m not really sure I want to get involved. Between facing a huge remodel of the above-mentioned “house”, getting my son situated in his new school, opening my potions store and dealing with one of the ghosts from my last house who somehow thumbed a ride to this one, I’ve got my hands full. Actually, more than full.</p> <p>Good thing I’ve got a few handsome neighbors to call on - Marty Zach, a self-professed ghost exorcist who just happens to have the sexiest smile, and Roy Osbourne, a bear of a man who looks like he alone coined the word ‘lumberjack.’</p>";
