Starving for affection, companionship, and love, the debilitating depression demons begin to sink their teeth into his already damaged psyche.</p> <p>He becomes obsessed with a beautiful woman half his age. Only problem is, Ophelia Sallis won't give him the time of day. Desperate to find friends and female companionship, Mac seeks the aid of Voodoo witch Magdeline Ortega who casts a love spell to unite the two.
