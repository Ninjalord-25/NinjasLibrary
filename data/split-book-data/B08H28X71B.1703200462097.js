window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There’s only one thing you really need to know about the world I come from: The witch council is as archaic and backward in their ways as they are powerful.</p> <p>So, when they arrange for me to marry the most powerful warlock in the world so that I can give them magic babies, I do what any sensible 24-year old would do.</p> <p>I run. Or, at least, I try to. Turns out, when push comes to shove, they’re willing to bargain on the whole marriage thing.</p> <p>To keep my life the way I like it, I just have to do one little thing: claim my powers. Easier said than done when the unruly power awakened inside of me is a magic that shouldn’t exist.</p> <p>As if that wasn’t bad enough, my mystic meant to guide me through the change is the very warlock I was supposed to marry. Now, I’m faced with another bargain, and this time, there’s no getting out of it.</p> <p>Train with Callan and learn how to control my magic...or face the council’s wrath.</p> <p>One of these things is sure to end in my demise. The other? I give it a 50-50 shot.</p> <p><i>Rebel Witch </i>is the first book in the House of Magic series, an enemies-to-lovers paranormal romance with humor and some steam.
