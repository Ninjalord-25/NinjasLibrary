I'm 40 years old and living above our empty restaurant, plotting my next move.</p> <p>And then the world around starts lighting up - literally catching on fire. I'm starting to think my defining characteristic may not be my snark or my cupcake-baking prowess, but spontaneous combustion.</p> <p>I'm done suppressing my anger. I'm done playing by other people's rules. Ready to take the reins on my destiny, I'm making the choices I used to be too afraid to make. Like my favorite cast iron skillet, women get better with age. And at 40, I know exactly who I am and what I want.</p> <p>I'll embrace the fire and the fury. This is my life, and I'm in control.</p>";
