I ran a successful business in a tight-knit magical community, and lived just blocks from a beautiful lake and series of hiking trails.</p> <p>Then Selene showed up.</p> <p>According to some magical code I inherit my aunt's ancient familiar; a grumpy 10-pound cat with a broken filter. She fancies herself something of a saber-toothed tiger, and claims to have wrestled the thread of her ninth life from the hands of the Fates themselves - although, I'm pretty sure that last part isn't true.</p> <p>Almost positive.</p> <p>I'm still looking into the magical fine print, but in the meantime I'm stuck as the guardian to a cat with the personality of Sophia from the Golden Girls. Oh, and by another cruel twist of fate, my ex-husband just moved back into town. I thought I couldn't take any more, but when a murder rocks my small community, I wind up entangled in the investigation thanks to a handsome stranger.</p> <p>If only life came equipped with a rewind button.</p>";
