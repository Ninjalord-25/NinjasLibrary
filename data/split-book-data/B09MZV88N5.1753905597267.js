window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Taylor is the name, John Taylor. My card says I'm a detective, but what I really am is an expert on finding lost things. It's part of the gift I was born with as a child of the Nightside.</p> <p>I left there a long time ago, with my skin and sanity barely intact. Now I make my living in the sunlit streets of London. But business has been slow lately, so when Joanna Barrett showed up at my door, reeking of wealth, asking me to find her runaway teenage daughter, I didn't say no.</p> <p>Then I found out exactly where the girl had gone.</p> <p>The Nightside. That square mile of Hell in the middle of the city, where it's always three a.m. Where you can walk beside myths and drink with monsters. Where nothing is what it seems and everything is possible.</p> <p>I swore I'd never return. But there's a kid in danger and a woman depending on me. So I have no choice - I'm going home.</p>";
