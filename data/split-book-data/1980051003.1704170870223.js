window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Swords, Sex, and Rockets!&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Paradise falls. Humanity is thrown back to an age of steel and blood. Now the fuel that powers the \"changed\" world is up for grabs in an orbiting spacecraft. With only days to plan, rough and ready paladin Herzer Herrick must assemble a team of expert warriors capable of both seat-of-the-pants engineering and hand-to-hand combat in space. In the meantime, Herzer must face his own demons as he waits for his emotionally-scarred fiancé to recover and finally bed him. And if that's not enough, there's a horde of \"changed\" orcs and goblins who are intent on delivering the power above to their totalitarian masters below. This is one space race free humanity cannot afford to lose!&nbsp;</p> <p>Multiple <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best seller John Ringo delivers another rousing entry in his Council Wars saga!</p>";
