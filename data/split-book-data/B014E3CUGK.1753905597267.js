window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An ongoing, episodic \"prose comic\" from which the pictures are summoned by the magic of words, <i>Goon Squad</i> is set in a version of modern-day Manchester. Its biggest divergence from the real city is that it - along with most other large urban centers - has a team of superheroes to protect it against unusual threats with which the conventional forces of law and order would have problems. </p> <p><i>Goon Squad, Volume 1: Special Talents</i> is composed of six tales: \"The New Girl\", \"Nightclubbing\", \"By the Water, by the Grave\", \"Changes\", \"No-No Dojo\", and \"Exterminating Angel\" as well as an introduction read by the author. </p>";
