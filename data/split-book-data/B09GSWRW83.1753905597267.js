Staying with his wife seems like the obvious choice, right? Wrong. Pete quickly realizes the spirit world is an ambiguous, unpredictable place, where time seems to whiz by and stand still simultaneously, rendering him a helpless observer to those still living. That is, until he finds his reason. That’s when Pete discovers he isn’t so helpless anymore. </p> <p>When Joe Morton dies, it isn’t the unknown he fears - it’s never having the opportunity to meet his unborn grandson, Josh. For this reason, Joe stays behind, excited to watch his grandson grow - only to end up cursing the spirit world he’s trapped in, the veil that will separate them forever. Until it doesn’t. Until everything changes when Josh reveals a special gift that must be kept secret at all costs. </p> <p>When the three are summoned by strange and powerful forces, they converge on the battlefields of Gettysburg, where wars still rage and bloodthirsty spirits never rest, fighting for something that only Pete, Joe, and Josh may be able to give them: an escape from the evil forces dominating the spirit world, and the chance to finally cross over.<i> Walk toward the light.</i></p>";
