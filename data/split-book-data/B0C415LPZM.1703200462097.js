window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the first book of this imaginative LitRPG series, a quirky young woman embarks on the adventure of a lifetime in a virtual-reality fantasy game.</b></p> <p>Arwyn has just purchased <i>Fantasia: Fantasy Life</i>, an immersive virtual-reality game that allows sleeping players to dive into a world of sword and sorcery with 99% realism. In Fantasia, Arwyn is Fey E’lan, a moon elf of the magical Elvenwood, whose unorthodox approach to gameplay—from befriending local monsters to putting a bag of holding inside a bag of holding—leads to a variety of unusual adventures and hilarious mishaps.</p> <p>Soon Fey is a Guardian of the Forest, with a small army of loyal pets by her side. And as her reputation grows, so do her accidental friendships with other players curious about the free-spirited gamer. Then an NPC, the celestial warrior-angel Leandriel, comes crashing (literally) into her life and Fey’s carefree attitude is severely shaken. Leandriel seems almost&nbsp;…&nbsp;human. Compared to the robotic AI populating most other VR games, that is.</p> <p>But in a land where both fantasy conventions and physics are honored and upended in equal measure, and the definition of “realism” is pushed to the limits, Fey will discover it’s much more fun to play the game when you play by your own rules.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than three million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
