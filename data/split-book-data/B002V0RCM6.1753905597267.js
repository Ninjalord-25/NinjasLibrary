The time is now. The place is the Trident, a long-range research vessel hired by the reality TV show Sealife. Aboard is a cast of ambitious young scientists. With a director dying for drama, tiny Henders Island might be just what the show needs. Until the first scientist sets foot on Henders - and the ultimate test of survival begins...</p> <p>For when they reach the island’s shores, scientists are utterly unprepared for what they find - creatures unlike any ever recorded in natural history. This is not a lost world frozen in time, an island of mutants, or a lab where science has gone mad: This is the Earth as it might have looked after evolving on a separate path for half a billion years.</p> <p>Soon the scientists will stumble on something more shocking than anything humanity has ever encountered: Because among the terrors of Henders Island, one life form defies any scientific theory - and must be saved at any cost.</p>";
