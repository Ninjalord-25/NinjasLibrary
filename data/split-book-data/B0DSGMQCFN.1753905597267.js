As a workaholic and a loner, his career has been his life thus far, so why wouldn't it continue to be? But then his Soul Merge fails, and the System decides to find a compromise, classing him as something weirder: a <i>Demonic</i> Magician.</p> <p>Armed with a card deck of new tricks, his showmanship skills, <i>and</i> the power to summon demons, Max is ready to fight his way through this realm of pink slimes, monsters and opposing Players. But as he builds his team—including strong-willed elf Ren and grizzly bear Wolf—to get to the mainland and escape the System, he might just encounter some things he never expected to: friendship, love, possibly even a family of his own. As long as he doesn't get eaten first . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitPRG fantasy series—with more than 600,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
