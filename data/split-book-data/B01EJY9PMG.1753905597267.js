window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Around midnight, under a lonely streetlamp in a provincial town in Japan, lies a white woman, a blonde, alone, robbed of all four limbs yet undead. Indeed, a rumor's been circulating among the local girls that a vampire has come to their backwater, of all places. </p> <p>Koyomi Araragi, who prefers to avoid having friends because they'd lower his \"intensity as a human\", is naturally skeptical. Yet it is to him that the bloodsucking demon, a concept \"dated twice over\", beckons on the first day of spring break as he makes his way home with a fresh loot of morally compromising periodicals. </p> <p>Always disarmingly candid, often hilariously playful, and sometimes devastatingly moving, <i>KIZUMONOGATARI: Wound Tale</i> is the perfect gateway into the world of author NISIOISIN, the best-selling young novelist in Japan today. The prequel to <i>BAKEMONOGATARI</i> (\"Monster Tale\"), this is where the legendary MONOGATARI series, whose anime adaptations have enjoyed international popularity and critical acclaim, begins. </p>";
