I devoured it, and I couldn’t stop.\" (<i>Boundless Book Reviews</i>)</p> <p>Broke and living in a one-bedroom apartment the size of a closet is not what you’d expect from an elite hunter like me. But hunting demons and half-breeds isn’t your average nine-to-five job with benefits. The hours are long and the pay usually sucks. I didn’t think I was going to make rent again until the Council, the group of angel-born who’d shunned me all those years ago, offered me a job - a paying one. I could either tell them to shove it, or take the job. So what’s a gal to do? Take the gig, of course.</p> <p>Everything would have worked out fine if the Council hadn’t forced me to work the case with Jax - an angel-born warrior who happened to be way too pretty to be legal. Turns out Jax has an agenda of his own and is determined to make my life hell, but I’m stuck with him. For now. And things went downhill from there when I found out the demon I’m hunting is a Greater demon. And yeah, it’s hunting me too. Swell.</p> <p><i>Dark Hunt</i> is a sassy, fast-paced urban fantasy filled with demons, angels, vampires, werewolves, witches, fae, leprechauns, jinn, and shifters. If you enjoy urban fantasy books with a kick-ass heroine and plenty of action, suspense, and humor, then you’ll love listening to <i>Dark Hunt</i>.</p>";
