Yet even a jinni can’t wish away a wrongful imprisonment.

Here is where Sidra’s true destiny awaits, but danger also lurks in the village’s narrow lanes. </p> <p>On her trail is Jamra, another jinni, who’s after more than revenge for the murder of his brother.

When he learns of an ancient relic capable of unleashing chaos on the world, and that the weapon is in the hands of his murderous sister-in-law, he vows to destroy Sidra to get it. </p> <p>Relying on a sisterhood of magic, a mysteriously faithful dog, and a second-rate sorcerer, Sidra defends herself using the village’s greatest asset: its perfume.
