window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How does a con man survive with no one around to fool but himself? Who does a knight battle when the demons in the dark begin to pale next to his own? And what, exactly, does a minotaur do when he finally gets a vacation day?</p> <p>These are stories from the world of Ethereal Earth, a place where legends and myths hide among us in plain sight, and occasionally just need to get some laundry done. Here you’ll find scenes that didn’t have a place in the main series, with new events that fall between the first three books to expand the lore and give fresh insight into some of your favorite characters - all with the same snarky and sinister mix you know and love. And maybe a few secrets too, if that’s your kind of thing.</p> <p><i>Short Changed</i> is the first story collection in the Ethereal Earth series, an ongoing tale of adventure and excitement and intrigue, and a group of people who didn’t ask for any of it.</p>";
