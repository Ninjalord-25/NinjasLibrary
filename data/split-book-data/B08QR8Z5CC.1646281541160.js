window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For a decade, I’ve hated the supernaturals who owned my world. I hunted them. I killed them.</p> <p>And now, in the most grand twist of fate - I am bonded to one of them.</p> <p>Oh, the irony.</p> <p>Being a supernatural bounty hunter isn’t exactly a popular job. But after the magic wars, there aren’t many things a human can do that will put food on the table. Thankfully, anything my right hook can’t handle, my guns can.</p> <p>Or so I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When a demon summoning runs awry, the being that comes into this world changes everything. I’m not sure if he’s truly a demon or a god, but one thing I do know is that he’s after me. I’d like to see him try.</p> <p>I’ve got a promise to fulfill, and I’m not backing down. The only way out of this is his death or mine, and I’ll do anything to survive. Even if that means making a deal with the devil.</p> <p></p> <p>If you can’t get enough of books by Ella Summers, Annette Marie, Shannon Mayer, Deborah Wilde, K.F. Breene, Jeaniene Frost, Kelly St. Clare, and Linsey Hall then dive right in to the dangerous depths of New Chicago. Beware of headstrong heroines with snark. These ladies don’t bark. They bite.
