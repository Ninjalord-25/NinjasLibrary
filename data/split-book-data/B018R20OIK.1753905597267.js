window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After five years as a city guard, Durham's horizontal career trajectory adds a corkscrew when a mis-delivered order assigns him to caravan duty for an eclectic group of dwarves who hire themselves out as professional dungeoneers. No ruler wants to leave a powerful magical weapon lying about in a dungeon where just any prophesied upstart can stumble across it and use it to overthrow the kingdom. That's where the dungeoneers come in. Dungeons sacked, artifacts recovered, no job too big or too small. They're not adventurers; they're professionals. With the discovery that Durham may have arrived with a destiny attached to him, the dungeoneers find themselves in the midst of some history about to happen. Will experience and Dwarven know-how be enough to carry the day? </p>";
