It falls to Chance’s friends to pick up the slack.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Mage Enough</i>, Lucas is confronted with the consequences of helping Chance during an earlier adventure and must delve into the vampire subculture of New Essex in order to find a missing priest. As he uncovers another, greater threat, he also discovers that he’s capable of far more than he ever thought possible.</p> <p>In <i>Freedom</i>, Shade learns that there is much more to the world behind the Veil than she ever suspected. When Lucas shows up needing her help for a newfound friend, she’s more than willing to assist. But they quickly discover that he’s taken something that the vampires will go to any lengths to get back. In trying to keep those around her safe, she will discover what it truly means to live free, and how far she’ll go to safeguard that right.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Those Who Can</i>, Dr. Corwyn discovers how far the conspiracy Lucas and Shade have uncovered goes, and how much the Conclave doesn’t know. Drafted back into a role he had given up years ago, he must figure out how the Sentinels have changed over the years, and if he can do the job now. As he struggles to find his way in his old/new role, he finds an even bigger conspiracy and the hint of something familiar.</p>";
