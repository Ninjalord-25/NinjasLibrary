window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Vampires don't exist. At least, not anymore....\"</b><br> <br> I celebrated when vampires were declared extinct.<br> <br> Those beasts had preyed on humanity for millennia, committing senseless, brutal murders. Like the rest of my colleagues at the Occult Bureau, I looked forward to a world where we could all sleep at night - where constant cover-up jobs were no longer required to keep the public calm and unaware.<br> <br> But the end of vampires wasn't the end of our problems. It was only the beginning.<br> <br> Other blood-sucking creatures began to lurk in the night. As soon as I turned 21, I became a ground agent at the Bureau because I wanted - no, <i>needed</i> - to join the fight.<br> <br> And then Dorian Clave burst into my life - turning everything I thought I knew into quicksand. Vampires like him were killers who devoured humanity's inner darkness until shadows danced beneath their skin. Yet there was more to him than that.<br> <br> He showed me that light cannot exist without the dark, and that trying to fight this balance would have consequences our human minds couldn't even comprehend.</p> <p><b>Because sometimes darkness needs to exist.</b><br> <br> <b><i>Twilight fans, welcome to a thrilling new world....</i></b></p> <p>_____________________________________________</p> <p>If you've enjoyed Stephenie Meyer or Cassandra Clare, <i>Darklight</i> will have you hooked.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buy now and begin the journey....</p> <p><i>*Beware of spoilers in the reviews below that are without spoiler alerts.*</i>&nbsp;</p>";
