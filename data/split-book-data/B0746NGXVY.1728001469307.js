window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The media has a nickname for Marnie Baranuik, though she'd rather they didn't; they call her the Great White Shark, a rare dual-talented forensic psychic. Twice-Touched by the Blue Sense - which gives her the ability to feel the emotions of others, and read impressions left behind on objects - Marnie also has a doctorate in preternatural biology and a working knowledge of the dark arts. She is considered without peer in the psychic community. </p> <p>Then her first big FBI case ended with a bullet in one shoulder and a chip on the other, a queasy heart and a serial killer in the wind, leaving her a public flop and a private wreck. When the FBI's preternatural crimes unit tracks her down at a remote mountain lodge for her insight on a local case, her quiet retirement is promptly besieged by a stab-happy starlet, a rampaging ghoul, and a vampire-hunting jackass in tight Wranglers. Marnie figures the only real mystery is which one will kill her first. </p> <p>Too mean to die young, backed up by friends in cold places, and running with a mouth as demure as a cannon's blast, Marnie Baranuik is about to discover that there's no such thing as quitting time when you're Touched. </p>";
