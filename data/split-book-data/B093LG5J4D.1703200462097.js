window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Centuries ago, we lost our world. Planetary Acquisitions keeps us alive solely to maintain their vast fleet of gate ships in an endless quest to find them new worlds to settle - or to conquer. Years flutter by like a tree shedding its spring petals, and so we desperately cling to this chunk of dirt-and-machine we call home.&nbsp;</p> <p>And all those centuries since, we've been looking for a way out, risky as it might be. Are we fools?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Traitors, Thieves and Liars </i>is the first book in a trilogy retelling the events of <i>Ten Thousand Miles Up</i> in a grand epic. The geroo have been trapped in slavery for centuries, searching for useful planets for their krakun masters. And then, one day, pirates contact Captain Ateri with an opportunity that may prove too good to be true.</p> <p>Includes the short story \"Whatever Happened to Commissioner Sarsuk?\" which details the downfall of the former commissioner of the fleet.</p>";
