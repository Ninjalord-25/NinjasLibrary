window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A gripping folk-horror thriller from the author of </b><b><i>The Ritual</i></b></p> <p><i>One million years of evolution didn't change our nature. Nor did it bury the horrors predating civilization. Ancient rites, old deities, and savage ways can reappear in the places you least expect.</i></p> <p>Lifestyle journalist Katrine escaped past traumas by moving to a coast renowned for seaside holidays and natural beauty. But when a vast hoard of human remains and prehistoric artifacts is discovered in nearby Brickburgh, a hideous shadow engulfs her life.</p> <p>Helene, a disillusioned lone parent, lost her brother, Lincoln, six years ago. Disturbing subterranean noises he recorded prior to vanishing, draw her to Brickburgh's caves. A site where early humans butchered each other across 60,000 years. Upon the walls, images of their nameless gods remain.</p> <p>Amidst rumors of drug plantations and new sightings of the mythical red folk, it also appears that the inquisitive have been disappearing from this remote part of the world for years. A rural idyll where outsiders are unwelcome and where an infernal power is believed to linger beneath the earth. A timeless super-normal influence that only the desperate would dream of confronting. But to save themselves and those they love, and to thwart a crimson tide of pitiless barbarity, Kat and Helene are given no choice. They were involved and condemned before they knew it.</p> <p><i>The Reddening</i> is an epic story of folk and prehistoric horrors written by Adam Nevill, the author of <i>The Ritual</i>, <i>Last Days</i>, <i>No One Gets Out Alive</i>, and the three times winner of the August Derleth Award for best horror novel.</p>";
