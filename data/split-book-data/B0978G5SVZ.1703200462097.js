window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Stay away from the trees! </b></p> <p>In Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula, Kira Brine hires a group of friends to help restore her private cottage. The fun little endeavor quickly turns tense as they hear strange noises in the woods. Branches snap and leaves rustle in the distance. Animals seem uncharacteristically frightened and then mysteriously disappear as the hours go on.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tension escalates into panic with the revelation that something is stalking the group. Something large. Something unnatural. Its claws can slice through bone with ease. Its web will ensnare anything at the slightest touch. Its venom can immobilize a human within seconds. It is a corruption of nature; a genetically spliced nightmare; an arachnoid. Now, it is loose, and it needs to feed.</p>";
