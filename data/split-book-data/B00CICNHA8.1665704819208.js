window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the deft hands of Neil Gaiman, magic is no mere illusion... and anything is possible. In <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i>, Gaiman's imagination and supreme artistry transform a mundane world into a place of terrible wonders - where an old woman can purchase the Holy Grail at a thrift store, where assassins advertise their services in the Yellow Pages under \"Pest Control,\" and where a frightened young boy must barter for his life with a mean-spirited troll living beneath a bridge by the railroad tracks. </p> <p>Explore a new reality, obscured by smoke and darkness yet brilliantly tangible, in this extraordinary collection of short works by a master prestidigitator. It will dazzle your senses, touch your heart, and haunt your dreams. </p>";
