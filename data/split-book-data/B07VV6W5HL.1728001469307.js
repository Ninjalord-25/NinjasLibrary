window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Whether it's kitsune running rampant in the museum, were-gorillas rampaging at the zoo, or a cupid wreaking havoc on her daughter's birthday party, Jess Friedman can handle any monster the supernatural community of Cleveland can throw at her.</p> <p>Except maybe the disapproving stares from the women at her daughter's day care. Or the awkward conversations with her rabbi about her working for the Catholic Church as a New Templar, hunting down the things that go bump in the night.</p> <p>That's right, Jess Friedman isn't just an ordinary mother of three trying to make it through the world, she's also the official Cleveland Regional Monster Hunter for the Holy Roman Catholic Church (What? You thought Bubba was the only one?). This Jewish mother is anything but stereotypical as she battles demons, tames monsters, negotiates with a vampire lord, and tries to get snacks delivered to her daughter's kindergarten class on time!</p> <p>This hilarious volume collects the first four Monster Hunter Mom novellas by J.D. Blackrose (The Soul Wars):</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Tweety &amp; the Monkey Man</i></li> <li><i>Runaway</i></li> <li><i>Handle with Care</i></li> <li><i>End of the Line</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>The Monster Hunter Mom stories take place in the popular Bubba the Monster Hunter shared universe, along with the escapades of Mark Wojcik, Mason Dixon, Caitlin Kelley, and of course, Bubba himself.</p>";
