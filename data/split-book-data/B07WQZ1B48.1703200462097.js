window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"There is a white wizard, cloaked in spellcraft and guile and a truly astonishing sense of self-righteousness, and he <i>simply will not stop slaughtering The Chosen One until he kills me</i>.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>Set in a fantasy world of unmanageable magics and questionable cosmology, <i>There and NEVER, EVER Back Again: A Dark Lord's Journal </i>is the peculiar, blackly satirical tale of the Dark Lord, who is amassing an army of Things of the Night, and awaiting likely death at the hands of:&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Elves</b>: A beautiful, shiny, sociopathic species whose language is entirely sarcasm.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Dwarves</b>: Doomed hammer-swinging dwellers of the underground.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Armies of Man:</b> No one tells a better tale, or causes a more rapid extinction.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The White Wizard</b>: Embodiment of all that is good and right; just ask him.&nbsp;</p> <p>....and&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Chosen One:</b> Victim - sorry, meant to say \"Hero\" - of a glorious prophecy.&nbsp;The Chosen One is destined to bring down the Dark Lord, if not killed first.&nbsp;In which case, The White Wizard will have to find a replacement.&nbsp;<i>Again</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Behold!&nbsp;A (relatively) epic narration of world-changing events, told from the point of view of the Dark Lord.
