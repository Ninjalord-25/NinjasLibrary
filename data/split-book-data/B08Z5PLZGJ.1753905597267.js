But that's a small inconvenience, especially with the <i>Model Middle America</i> reality show holding auditions for the Next Top Heartland Teen Heartthrob Model right in Kallie's hometown.</p> <p>Now that she has a chance to make her dream come true, Kallie is determined not to let anything stand in her way - not her best frenemy, Amory Franklin, not her lacrosse-playing crush, Blake Turner, and especially not the new, awkward fat kid in her computer class.</p> <p>And while the sudden appearance of her PhD-in-nuclear-nanotechnologist grandmother definitely throws Kallie off, the rest of the world will soon find out that it's not over until the fat lady sings - or in this case, it's not over until Fatgirl sits on a terrorist's face.</p> <p><i>You'll never look at doughnuts the same way again.</i></p> <p><i>Perfect for anyone who's ever felt out of place in high school and never felt good enough for others to love you for who you are. </i></p> <p><b><i>Fatgirl: Origins: Part One</i></b><b> is the first in a new series featuring a satirical science fiction superhero take on growing up, PC culture, and diet culture from award-winning, genre-hopping author C. S. Johnson.</b></p>";
