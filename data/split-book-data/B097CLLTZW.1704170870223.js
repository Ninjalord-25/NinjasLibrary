window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I’m falling in love with a demon, but is my soul worth the risk?&nbsp;</p> <p>Life used to be simple: work during the week, ghost-hunting on the weekends. I was always better with ghosts than guys, anyway. But life gets a lot more complicated when a violent haunting threatens our paranormal investigation team and a sexy stranger who claims to be a demon is the only one who can help.&nbsp;</p> <p>When someone breaks into my apartment and leaves a warning, I begin to realize that sometimes, the living are a lot more terrifying than ghosts. The problem is, I have no idea if the warning is about the demon Maxwell or a ghost we’re trying to help. Then, someone tries to kill me, and I don’t know if I’m the target of a demon hunter or something worse....</p>";
