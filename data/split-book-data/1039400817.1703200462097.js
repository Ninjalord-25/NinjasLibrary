window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A normal, if not rebellious, human, Cameron Dupree has spent the last three years finding his way through a school of the rich and powerful...literally. </b></p> <p>He's surrounded by the supernatural cream of the crop: children of alpha werewolves, banshees with ties to the United Nations, a faerie princess from another realm of reality, and a teenage succubus who might be the scariest, and sexiest, of them all. Everything is going as great as can be for a vanilla human...until one misstep lands him in trouble with a noble of the Unseelie Fae. Caught between the wrath of a Fae Court and the desire of a Succubus Cabal, Cam must fight to survive, and figure out he might not be that normal after all.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Courts and Cabals</i> contains adult situations and supernatural creatures that generally treat humans like s#!t. It's intended for a mature audience.</p>";
