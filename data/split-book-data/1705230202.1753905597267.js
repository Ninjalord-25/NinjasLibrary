My brother made a big mistake, and now I have to fix it by stealing from the most powerful and cruel vampire to ever come to Bloodstone, Lucca Della Morte. If that wasn't almost suicidal, I need to get it done before the spell concealing my human nature wears off. </p> <p>But I forget that I'm only pretending to be a vampire. I'm still human and susceptible to Lucca's dangerous allure. His darkness calls to my soul. His savagery makes my blood sing. I'm falling for the dark prince, craving him in a visceral way that's frightening and exciting at the same time. </p> <p>If he discovers my secret, he'll destroy me. And yet, I can't help wanting to get closer. I never thought I had a death wish until I met him. </p> <p><i>Contains mature themes.</i></p>";
