But an ancient evil is looming, and what seems like a safe haven may not be all it appears. </p> <p>Snared and murdered by a vile, arcane horror, Chet quickly learns that pain and death are not unique to the living. Now the lives and very souls of his wife and unborn child are at stake. To save them, he must journey into the bowels of purgatory in search of a sacred key promised to restore the natural order of life and death. Alone, confused, and damned, Chet steels himself against the unfathomable terrors awaiting him as he descends into death's stygian blackness. </p> <p>With <i>Lost Gods</i>, Brom's gritty and visceral prose takes us on a haunting, harrowing journey into the depths of the underworld.
