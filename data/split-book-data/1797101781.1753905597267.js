Sheriff Norris Ridgewick and his team are desperately searching for two missing girls, but time is running out to bring them home alive.</p> <p>In Washington, DC, 37-year-old Gwendy Peterson couldn’t be more different from the self-conscious teenage girl who once spent a summer running up Castle Rock’s Suicide Stairs. That same summer, she was entrusted - or some might say cursed - with the extraordinary button box by Richard Farris, the mysterious stranger in the black suit. The seductive and powerful box offered Gwendy small gifts in exchange for its care and feeding until Farris eventually returned, promising Gwendy she’d never see the box again.</p> <p>One day, though, the button box shows up without warning - and without Richard Farris to explain why, or what she’s supposed to do with it. The mysterious reappearance of the box, along with the troubling disappearances in Castle Rock, leads Gwendy home again...where she just might be able to help rescue the missing girls and stop a madman before he does something ghastly.</p> <p>From <i>New York Times</i> best seller Richard Chizmar comes <i>Gwendy's Magic Feather</i>, a breathtaking novel that asks whether our lives are controlled by fate or the choices we make - and what price we might have to pay for those choices when we reach for the things we most desire. Prepare to return again to Stephen King’s Castle Rock, the sleepy little town built on a bedrock of deep, dark secrets, which is about to awaken from its quiet slumber once more.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
