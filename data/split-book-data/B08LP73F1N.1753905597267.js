Especially when the city’s latest threat has targeted her to help it escape from an ancient book it’s been imprisoned in for more than a century. You see, Katie isn’t your average girl - she’s a bit of a beast and owns a tattoo shop at the edge of town. She’s also the only one who can tattoo a magical symbol on the demon’s back that will set it permanently free - and live to tell about it.</p> <p>Trying to run a business and keep her secrets intact, Katie’s life is complicated enough. The easy thing would be to just apply the damn ink and be done with it, but there’s just one problem - the demon plans to open the crossroads and let all hell break loose. If that happens, the city might as well get used to serving a new master.</p> <p>With the help of her best friend, Lady Sugar - the queen of Savannah with hoodoo in her blood, and a coven of eclectic witches, they’ll fight to take back their city.</p> <p>No shrinking violets here. Maybe just a few misfits. Katie Bishop’s clan has plenty of heart and grit, and Sugar will have you rolling!</p> <p>Typical urban fantasy? Not exactly.</p>";
