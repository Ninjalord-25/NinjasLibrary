In his view the galaxy has given him a gift: a mutation that allows him to withstand great deals of physical trauma. He puts his abilities to the best use possible and that isn't by being a scientist. </p> <p>Besides, the space station Belvaille doesn't need scientists. It is not, generally, a thinking person's locale. It is the remotest habitation in the entire Colmarian Confederation. There is literally no reason to be there. </p> <p>Unless you are a criminal. </p> <p>Because of its location, Belvaille is populated with nothing but crooks. Every day is a series of power struggles between the crime bosses. </p> <p>Hank is an intrinsic part of this community as a premier gang negotiator. Not because he is eloquent or brilliant or an expert combatant, but because if you shoot him in the face he keeps on talking. </p> <p>Hank believes he has it pretty good until a beautiful and mysterious blue woman enters his life with a compelling job offer. </p> <p>Hank and Belvaille, so long out of public scrutiny, suddenly find themselves the epicenter of the galaxy with a lot of very unwelcome attention.</p>";
