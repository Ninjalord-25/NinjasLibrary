Then the Mob wars between the vampires and werewolves spilled over from the big city, along with supernatural bounty hunters, necromancer narcos, a monster trafficking ring, paranormal bookies, warring secret government agencies, and wicked witches.</p> <p>To rein in the chaos, Mark will need to call on all his resources—Father Leo, Donny the Werewolf, the Scooby Gang of supernaturally-talented young adults he mentors, and other friends with the kind of special talents to handle things that go bump in the night. They're making it up as they go, breaking all the rules, and kicking monster butt.</p>";
