Martinez.</b></p> <p>It is a new world, stunned by the horrors that linger in the aftermath of total war. The United States and Soviet Union are squaring off in a different kind of conflict, one thatâ€™s fought in the shadows, where there are whispers of strange and mysterious developments....</p> <p>Normal people across the United States have inexplicably gained paranormal abilities. A factory worker can heal the sick and injured. A schoolteacher bends emotions to her will. A car salesman alters matter with a simple touch. A former soldier speaks to the dying and gains their memories as they pass on.</p> <p>They are the Variants, controlled by a secret government program called Majestic-12 to open a new front in the Cold War.</p> <p>From the deserts of Nevada to the palaces of Istanbul, the halls of power in Washington to the dark, oppressive streets of Prague, the Variants are thrown into a deadly game of shifting alliances. Amidst the seedy underbelly of nations, these once-ordinary Americans dropped in extraordinary circumstances will struggle to come to terms with their abilities as they fight to carve out a place for themselves in a world that may ultimately turn against them.</p> <p>And as the Majestic-12 program will soon discover, there are others out there like them, some with far more malevolent goals....</p> <p>Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for listeners interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more.
