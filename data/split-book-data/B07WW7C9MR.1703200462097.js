He’s also callous and cruel and hasn’t got a festive bone in his ancient body. Naturally, he’s due for a holiday haunting.&nbsp;</p> <p>When his business partner, Bolbi Baggs, announces that they’re to be visited by three spirits, Mr. Goldson braces himself for a whirlwind tour of his past, present, and future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Typically, a trio of time-traveling ghosts heralds a heartwarming tale of hope and redemption for the human race. Mr. Goldson, however, isn’t a member of the human race. He’s a Dwarf, and Mr. Baggs is a Halfling, and the adventure that’s about to take them across the enchanted world of Arth is anything but typical.&nbsp;</p> <p>Holiday magic and economic realities collide in <i>A Song of Three Spirits</i>. It’s <i>A Christmas Carol</i> for the 21st century, with a dash of high fantasy. Listen to this hilarious satire of Charles Dickens’s classic today!</p>";
