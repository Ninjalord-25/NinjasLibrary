window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dubbed the greatest horror story in English by Stephen King, <i>The Great God Pan</i> is an eerie and otherworldly mystery about a diabolical operation and its terrifying repercussions. After rescuing a young woman from the streets of London, Dr. Raymond uses her as a test subject for brain surgery aimed at \"lifting the veil\" of reality, to see the supernatural and the \"great god Pan\".&nbsp;</p> <p>The operation is a disaster and leaves the subject lobotomized. Years later, London becomes afflicted with a strange series of male suicides connected to a beautiful but sinister woman named Helen. Just who is she, and what is her connection to Dr. Raymond's failed experiment?&nbsp;</p> <p>First published in 1890, <i>The Great God Pan</i> influenced many writers of the genre, including the unrivalled master H.P. Lovecraft. It makes perfect listening for a dark and rainy evening.&nbsp;</p>";
