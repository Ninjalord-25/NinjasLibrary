Agent Söze is trying to cover it up, which is all the reason I need to make solving the murder my top priority.</p> <p>Except now Agent Söze is trying to arrest and/or kill me. Not entirely unexpected, but both dangerous and highly irritating.</p> <p>With the clock ticking on the next mysterious Guild Master murder, Lienna and I have to find a way to prove Agent Söze is behind it all. We need rock-solid evidence to bring him down, which is kind of tricky when crooked agents, shady allies, and cutthroat assassins keep complicating matters.</p> <p>And if we don't get to the bottom of it fast, my next day off will be in the morgue as another corpse to be swept under the corruption rug.</p>";
