window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Evil is raging on the 20th floor of an apartment building on the West Side. In an open window, a hideous blind nun perpetually gazing...watching. A body, burned beyond recognition. Then two more murders...strangely connected. And the discoverer, a beautiful young woman, raped. Her innocent child exposed to horror. Her husband, furious, relentlessly set on revenge. A cool, calculating, laughing priest intent on saving more lives from the destruction. And so it begins...powerful, satanic, terrifying...a time you will never forget. </p>";
