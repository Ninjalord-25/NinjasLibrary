In just a matter of hours, it became huge, a towering monstrosity made entirely out of tens of thousands of people and animals. </p> <p>This isn't behind-the-scenes bullshit from the point of view of the military. This isn't yet another conspiracy theory about what really happened to Air Force One that night, or about the decision to nuke Tucson. </p> <p>This is a rare, eyewitness account from someone who was there, in the midst of the destruction. But most importantly, this is the terrifying truth. </p>";
