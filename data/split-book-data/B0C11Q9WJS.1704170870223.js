window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An IT worker explores an alternate dimension in his office in the first book of a fun and fast-paced series blending cubical life and dungeon fantasy.</b></p> <p>Working as overnight tech support, James Lyle has long said he’d do anything to escape the boredom. But his commitment to excitement is tested when a slight coincidence one shift sends him to a different part of his office building&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he discovers a stairwell that contains not stairs but rather a landscape of seemingly infinite cubicles against a distant horizon.</p> <p>Unwilling (and unable) to stay away, James and a few of his trusted friends begin to explore this endless maze of supernatural business ennui, a few minutes in the real world turning into eight hours of encounters with strange creatures and even stranger interior design choices. But in a realm that allows them to level up in fax machine repair and provides them with enough cash to pay the rent, there are also adversaries that are quickly becoming dangerous—and potentially lethal.</p> <p>As James, along with his companions, delves ever deeper into this extraordinary place, he starts to realize that animate staplers and time dilation might not be the biggest challenges they face, and those challenges might not stop at the entrance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p><i>The Daily Grind</i> is the epic beginning to a slice-of-life urban fantasy that effortlessly blends wry commentary on office life with intricate character- and world-building.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than four million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
