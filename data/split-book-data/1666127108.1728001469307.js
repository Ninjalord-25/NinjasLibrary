window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is the story about how I died. Not really.... I mean, I don't remember most of it, thank goodness. Long story short, I was betrayed. Some people I thought I could trust invaded my sky palace, stole my women, and enslaved my pet shadow hounds.</p> <p>I was destroyed, utterly. Or so they thought.</p> <p>Somehow, mana, the source of my previous power, brought me back. The backstabbing weasels think they are safe, barricaded in their strongholds. Here's the horrible part. They willingly sacrificed their own flesh and blood for security. And they had the nerve to call me evil?</p> <p>Death wasn't all bad, I guess. It showed me what was truly important. But before I can get around to living my second life, I have some retribution to dish out.</p> <p>Yes, some will call me unnatural. Others, evil. Blah blah blah.</p> <p>I call myself the Manaborn.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
