window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Piper Griffiths wants one thing in life: To become a Consul, a keeper of the peace between humans and daemons. There are precisely three obstacles in her way. </p> <p>The first is Lyre. Incubus. Hotter than hell and with a wicked streak to match. His greatest mission in life is to get Piper into bed and otherwise annoy the crap out of her. </p> <p>The second is Ash. Draconian. Powerful. Dangerous. He knows too much and reveals nothing. Also, disturbingly attractive - and scary. Did she mention scary? </p> <p>The third is the Sahar Stone. Top secret magical weapon of mass destruction. Previously hidden in her Consulate until thieves broke in, went on a murder spree, and disappeared with the weapon. </p> <p>And they left Piper to take the fall for their crimes </p> <p>.Now she's on the run, her dreams of becoming a Consul shattered and every daemon in the city gunning to kill her. She's dead on her own, but there's no one she can trust - no one except two entirely untrustworthy daemons...see problems one and two. </p>";
