window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Writers of the Future grand prize winner Randy Henderson presents a dark and quirky debut in <i>Finn Fancy Necromancy</i>. </p> <p>Finn Gramaraye was framed for the crime of dark necromancy at the age of 15 and exiled to the Other Realm for 25 years. But now that he's free, someone--probably the same someone--is trying to get him sent back. Finn has only a few days to discover who is so desperate to keep him out of the mortal world and find evidence to prove it to the Arcane Enforcers. They are going to be very hard to convince since he's already been convicted of trying to kill someone with dark magic. </p> <p>But Finn has his family: his brother, Mort, who is running the family necrotorium business now; his brother, Pete, who believes he's a werewolf, though he is not; and his sister, Samantha, who is, unfortunately, allergic to magic. And he's got Zeke, a fellow exile and former enforcer who doesn't really believe in Finn's innocence but is willing to follow along in hopes of getting his old job back. </p>";
