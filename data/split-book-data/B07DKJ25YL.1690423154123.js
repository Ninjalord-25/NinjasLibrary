window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon brings us back to the astonishing world of the Dark-Hunters in </b><b><i>Stygian</i></b><b>, with a hero misunderstood by many…but most of all by himself.</b></p> <p>Born before man recorded time, I lived for thousands of years believing myself to be something I’m not.</p> <p>Some<i>one</i> I’m not.</p> <p>Lied to and betrayed by gods, Daimons, and Dark-Hunters, I’ve struggled to find my way in a world where I’ve been cursed since the moment I was prematurely ripped from my mother and planted into the womb of an innocent woman who thought me her son.</p> <p>Trained as a slayer and predator, I learned to fit in and stay low. To become a tool for evil. Until I was sent to kill the one woman I couldn’t. My hesitation cost her her life.</p> <p>Or so I thought. In an act of betrayal that makes all the others pale in comparison, I’ve learned that this world is an illusion and that my Phoebe still lives.</p> <p>Now I will have to travel into the very pits of Hades to try and save her, even as everyone around me attempts to steal what little soul I have left. There’s only one person at my back and I’m not sure I can trust her either, for she was born of an enemy race. Yet sometimes the road to redemption is one that singes us to our very core. And if I fail to find the answers I need to save Phoebe, more than just my wife will die.</p> <p>We will lose the world. Both human and Daimon.</p>";
