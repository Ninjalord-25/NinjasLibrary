window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>John Lago is a hitman. He has some rules for you. And he’s about to break every single one.</b></p> <p>John Lago is a very bad guy. But he’s the very best at what he does. And what he does is infiltrate top-level companies and assassinate crooked executives while disguised as an intern.</p> <p>Interns are invisible. That’s the secret behind HR, Inc., the elite “placement agency” that doubles as a network of assassins for hire who take down high-profile targets that wouldn’t be able to remember an intern’s name if their lives depended on it.</p> <p>At the ripe old age of almost 25, John Lago is already New York City’s most successful hit man. He’s also an intern at a prestigious Manhattan law firm, clocking 80 hours a week getting coffee, answering phones, and doing all the grunt work actual employees are too lazy to do. He was hired to assassinate one of the firm’s heavily guarded partners. His internship provides the perfect cover, enabling him to gather intel and gain access to pull off a clean, untraceable hit.</p> <p>Part confessional, part DIY manual, <i>The Intern’s Handbook</i> chronicles John’s final assignment, a twisted thrill ride in which he is pitted against the toughest - and sexiest - adversary he’s ever faced: Alice, an FBI agent assigned to take down the same law partner he’s been assigned to kill.</p>";
