window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A voyage of the Damned. </p> <p>The annual blessing of the fishing fleet is more than a ceremony, it provides God's protection from the demons of the sea. But Captain John Boston has no time for God and holy sanctions. The church has betrayed him, with the local priest refusing to protect his sister from a violent husband, and Boston's wife is seriously ill. </p> <p>The trawler hasn't had much luck this season and people are whispering that God has indeed turned his gaze from John Boston too, because he didn't accept the priest's traditional blessing. Now the boat is sailing one last time to try and fill its holds with fish. There's more than a mysterious fog, bad weather, and empty nets waiting for them. </p> <p>The devil has a boat of his own and he's out on the cold ocean, trawling for dead men and their souls. </p>";
