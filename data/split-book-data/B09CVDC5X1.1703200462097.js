window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the best swashbuckling novels!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Mark of Zorro</i> was originally entitled <i>The Curse of Capistrano</i>. It was the first work to feature the&nbsp;California&nbsp;character Diego Vega, the masked hero also called&nbsp;Zorro. Zorro&nbsp;is the Spanish word for&nbsp;fox.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story was adapted into the silent film&nbsp;<i>The Mark of Zorro</i>&nbsp;in 1920. A new version of&nbsp;<i>The Mark of Zorro</i>&nbsp;was produced in 1940 starring&nbsp;Tyrone Power&nbsp;as Don Diego Vega. The films met with high popularity and critical success. The 1940 film has been referenced in numerous&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;comics as the film that hero Bruce Wayne sees on the night his parents are murdered.&nbsp;</p> <p>The book tells of the story of&nbsp;Californio&nbsp;Don Diego Vega, alias \"Se√±or Zorro\", in the company of his deaf and mute servant Bernardo and his lover Lolita Pulido, as they oppose the villainous Captain Ramon and Sgt. Gonzales in early 19th century&nbsp;California&nbsp;during the era of&nbsp;Mexican rule, before it became a&nbsp;US state.</p>";
