BAFTA and Golden Globe award-winning actor Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>; <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>;<i> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>) reads the footnotes, and Peter Serafinowicz (<i>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</i>; <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>) stars as the voice of Death. Featuring a new theme tune composed by James Hannigan.<br> <br> <b><i>Twas the night before Hogswatch and all through the house...something was missing.</i></b><br> <br> The stockings are hanging ready, the sherry and pies are waiting by the fireplace - but where is the jolly fat man with his sack? It's not right to find Death creeping down chimneys and trying to say 'Ho ho ho' - but someone's got to bring the little kiddies their presents. Or else they might stop believing. Belief is important in Discworld, particularly on the last night of the year when the time is turning. If the real man in the red suit isn't found by morning, there won't be a morning. Ever again...<br> <br> A festive feast of darkness, jolly robins and tinsel. As they say: '<i>You'd better watch out...'</i><br> <br> <b><i>Hogfather</i></b><i> is the fourth book in the Death series, but you can listen to the Discworld novels in any order.</i><br> <br> <i>The first book in the Discworld series - </i><b><i>The Colour of Magic</i></b><i> - was published in 1983. Some elements of the Discworld universe may reflect this.</i><br> <br> </p>";
