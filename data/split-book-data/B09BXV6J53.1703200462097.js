window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What if murder wasn't a mystery?</p> <p>For one young man, it is always decided by a simple code of chance taught to him by his mentor, a gruff truck driver named Petty who once took him under his wing.</p> <p>Now a trucker himself, the savant travels the quickest routes coast to coast through 1990s America, listening to the Top 40 Countdown and holding the fate of those he encounters in the palm of his hand.</p> <p>But are the rules there to allow the natural order to assert itself or to keep a traumatic past from feeding his dark impulses and spiraling him out of control?</p> <p>A twisted thriller peppered with dark humor, B.H. Newton's <i>The Alternator</i> is a lean, mean story that just might put a wicked smile on your face. This book is intended for a mature audience&nbsp;and is not suitable for listeners under the age of 18.</p>";
