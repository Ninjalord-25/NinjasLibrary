Few have seen him, but those who claim they have say his hair is wild and nails are sharp - like a beast's! But how did this prince, once jovial and beloved by the people, come to be a reclusive and bitter monster? And is it possible that he can ever find true love and break the curse that has been placed upon him? </p> <p><i>Poor Unfortunate Soul: A Tale of the Sea Witch</i> </p> <p>The third novel in Serena Valentino's Villains trilogy features the story of the Little Mermaid from the perspective of the sea witch Ursula. </p>";
