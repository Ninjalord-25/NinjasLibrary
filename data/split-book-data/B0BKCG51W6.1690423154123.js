Over the past few weeks, I've painstakingly put my broken pieces back together, from the dark mysteries of my past to the heartrending conflict of my present.</p> <p>But just when I finally start to feel whole again, everything around me falls apart.</p> <p>Lallakai, the newly ascended Queen of Shadow and Death, betrays us and takes Zak prisoner. Echo, the powerful fae I thought would help save Zak, threatens to kill me. And Ríkr's nemesis, the ruthless Summer Queen, is hunting him again.</p> <p>With the four ancient fae poised to battle for supremacy, I'm the only one who can prevent a catastrophic clash of their power. But stopping them will require more than druidic magic. It'll take an act of destruction as devastating as they are.</p> <p>I'm about to test the strength of my scarred heart, and if I fail, I'll end up destroying everything—and everyone—I'm most desperate to protect.</p>";
