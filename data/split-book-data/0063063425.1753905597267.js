United by their vengeance. </b></p> <p>Iraya has spent her life in a cell, but every day brings her closer to freedom - and vengeance. </p> <p>Jazmyne is the queen’s daughter, but unlike her sister before her, she has no intention of dying to strengthen her mother’s power. </p> <p>Sworn enemies, these two witches enter a precarious alliance to take down a mutual threat. But power is intoxicating, revenge is a bloody pursuit, and nothing is certain - except the lengths they will go to win this game. </p> <p>\"A thundering waterfall of magic, vengeance and intrigue.\" (Samantha Shannon, <i>New York Times &amp; Sunday Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Priory of the Orange Tree </i>and <i>The Bone Season</i>)</p>";
