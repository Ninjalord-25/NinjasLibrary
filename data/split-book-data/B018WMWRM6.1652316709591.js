window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Harper Harlow lives in a world of ghosts. </p> <p>She sees them. She talks to them. She investigates them. She sends them on their merry way. </p> <p>She's not embarrassed by her abilities, and she's not afraid to be who she is. She's also not looking for a relationship. </p> <p>Enter Jared Monroe, a smooth-talking police detective who sees things in black and white and ignores any shades of gray. He doesn't believe in ghosts, and while he's intrigued by the feisty blonde ghost detective, he's not interested in the paranormal. </p> <p>When 21-year-old Annie Dresden's body washes up on the beach of Whisper Cove, Harper and Jared collide. Sparks may be flying, but so is confusion and mistrust. </p> <p>Harper calls on her loyal band of ghost hunters to solve the crime, and Jared relies on his training to tackle the same problem. It doesn't matter what approach they take because all paths are destined to intersect. </p> <p>Can Harper and Jared learn to work together? And, more importantly, can new ghosts let go of the past and give in to an obscure future? It's anyone's guess when big personalities go to war and find they might have more in common than they think. </p>";
