How will the once-average young man survive as his newfound title of Lost Lord makes him a target for assassins and terrorist organizations?</p> <p>Maxâ€™s new home is governed by the strong and over-encompassing System that regulates the world. Whether someone is a [Farmer], [Warrior], or a [Grand Magus], classes and abilities allow some to prosper while others fail.</p> <p>How do non-combative citizens live when monster attacks are a daily occurrence? They rely on people like Max, people who put aside their own safety to end threats before they can grow into true monsters.</p> <p>But what happens when the monster is a fellow human? An elf?
