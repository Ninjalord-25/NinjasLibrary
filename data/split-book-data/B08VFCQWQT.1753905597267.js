The next, I had discovered my magical roots, and my rightful place as the Guardian of the portal between the Faery and Earth. </p> <p>There was shock. And there was fear. After all, no one plans to start over at 45. I intended to grow old with my husband. I thought we’d live an ordinary life. So I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste this opportunity to live in a world I always thought was imaginary. </p> <p>I’m half-witch, half-faery, and facing dangers as real as the ache in my bad knee. Ibuprofen and caffeine keep me going, and I could do this for the rest of my life. Whoever thinks my family home is an easy mark better take notice: The new Guardian in town isn’t going down without a fight. </p> <p>After all, she’s already learned to let go of her simple existence and believe in the extraordinary power inside of her. What could possibly stop her now? </p>";
