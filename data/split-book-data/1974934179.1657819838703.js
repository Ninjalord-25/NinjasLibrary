Dani's busy with the grand opening of her family's pizza parlor when a knock on the door leaves her face to face with the stunning yet lethal vampire in charge of the NYPD's supernatural branch - Captain Matthew King.&nbsp;</p> <p>There's been a high-profile double homicide in the Sixth Borough, and Dani's peculiar talent is the only hope to untangle the web of lies and magic connecting the dead victims.
