A new, monster-free—except for his vampire cat—apartment.</p> <p>His new place comes with perks, too, like the hot girl who works at the cafe downstairs. She's the sexiest woman he's ever seen in a grandma sweater, and her coffee is so good it makes him feel like he can conquer the world. She has \"Lloyd's new girlfriend\" written all over her.
