Waking up after her accident, she finds herself at the mercy of an underground hybrid alien-human people with special abilities and a fascinating history.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Zakota people welcome her, but in doing so, have sealed her fate: she’ll never be allowed to leave. Greer rebels against this, struggling to come to terms with her new reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her life takes on as many twists and turns as there are dark passageways in the underground cavern where she now lives. She discovers a simple way of life, yet with unexpected, advanced technology. As Greer comes to know these people, including two potential love interests, she’ll be forced to decide between staying with the Zakotas, or escaping back to the outside world.</p>";
