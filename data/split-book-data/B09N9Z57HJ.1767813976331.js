With one look at her best friend's corpse, Liz Sharp already knows the truth: the killer is a werewolf.</p> <p>No one important will hold a werewolf accountable — after all, the monsters rule Europe. Certainly, no one will believe a werewolf victim like Liz: the very scars that make her determined to investigate Sal's death also condemn her as the sort of female who'd sell her blood for easy money.</p> <p>As it happens, Liz's best hope for justice might well lie with her emotionally repressed employer, Princess May. Though the princess has connections with werewolf royalty, there's no one else Liz can turn to. Certainly, she can't risk trusting the irritatingly personable Inspector Short, who dogs her steps from the slums of Whitechapel to the palaces of St James.</p> <p>But as corpses mount up, Liz discovers that no one is precisely who she thought: not Sal, not herself, and certainly not the werewolf.</p> <p>Luckily, she has a few tricks hidden in the pockets of her trusty bloomers….</p> <p>The first novel of <i>Miss Sharp's Monsters</i> is a witty historical fantasy adventure, perfect for fans of <i>The Parasol Protectorate</i> or <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies! </i>It includes <i>A Study in Sirens, </i>a bonus story from the series<i>.</i></p>";
