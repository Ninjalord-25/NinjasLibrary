Two years later, she steps into the bathroom for a break from her toddler's demands, only to discover a dense patch of hair on the back of her neck. In the mirror, her canines suddenly look sharper than she remembers. Her husband, who travels for work five days a week, casually dismisses her fears from faraway hotel rooms.</p> <p>As the mother's symptoms intensify, and her temptation to give in to her new dog impulses peak, she struggles to keep her alter-canine-identity secret. Seeking a cure at the library, she discovers the mysterious academic tome which becomes her bible, <i>A Field Guide to Magical Women: A Mythical Ethnography</i>, and meets a group of mommies involved in a multilevel-marketing scheme who may also be more than what they seem. </p> <p>An outrageously original novel of ideas about art, power, and womanhood wrapped in a satirical fairy tale, <i>Nightbitch</i> will make you want to howl in laughter and recognition. And you should. You should howl as much as you want.</p>";
