That is, until she signs on as a temp for a small consultancy whose principal, Misha Meserov, specialises in breaking up relationships. Misha is tall, infuriatingly handsome and effortlessly charismatic - he can make almost anyone, man or woman, fall into bed with him. And he often does.</p> <p>But the more Evie is exposed to Misha's scandalous world, the more she becomes convinced that he's hiding something.... When a wealthy San Francisco tech CEO with a dissolving marriage starts delving into the occult and turns up dead, Evie has to decide between her journalistic desire for the truth and her growing desire for Misha.</p>";
