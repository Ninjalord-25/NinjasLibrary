And if a villain decides to kidnap you, hold you hostage, or attempts to rob and/or kill you, please remain calm, heroes will arrive shortly. Thank you for your support! </p> <p>Dr. Davis Malory never planned to become a hero or a villain. He never planned on obtaining superpowers. He certainly never planned on being transported to a world filled with such people. And he most definitely never considered that he would have to become one if he ever wanted to find a way back to Earth. </p> <p>But Planet Hero doesn't care about what Davis wants. If he wants to survive everything that is about to be thrown at him, he'll have to cultivate his superpowers and learn to navigate this new world or going home will be the least of his worries. Davis' days as a civilian are officially over. </p> <p>Disclaimer: This is a LitRPG or GameLit novel containing video game elements and rules.</p>";
