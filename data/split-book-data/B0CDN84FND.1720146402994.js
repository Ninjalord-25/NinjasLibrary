window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Everfail will rise. His enemies will fall.</b></p> <p>Hiral is the Everfail, the weakest person on the flying island of Fallen Reach. He trains harder than any warrior. Studies longer than any scholar.</p> <p>But all his people are born with magic powered by the sun, flowing through tattoos on their bodies. Despite having enormous energy within, Hiral is the only one who can’t channel it; his hard work is worth nothing.</p> <p>Until it isn’t.</p> <p>In a moment of danger, Hiral unlocks an achievement with a special instruction: <b>Access a Dungeon to receive a Class-Specific Reward.</b></p> <p>It’s his first—and maybe last—chance for real power. Just one problem: all dungeons lay in the wilderness below the flying islands that humanity lives on, and there lay secrets and dangers that no one has survived.</p> <p>New powers await, but so do new challenges. If he survives? He could forge his own path to power.</p> <p>If he fails? Death will be the least of his problems.</p> <p><b>Don't miss the next progression fantasy series from J.M Clarke, bestselling author of </b><b><i>Mark of the Fool,</i></b><b> along with C.J. Thompson. Unlock a weak-to-strong progression into power and a detailed litRPG system with unique classes, skills, dungeons, achievements, survival and evolution.
