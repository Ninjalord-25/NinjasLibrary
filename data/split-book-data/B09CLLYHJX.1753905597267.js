The magical seal securing the five worlds has been fractured and the realms are colliding, creating distrust in the Dimension Protection Council and threatening war between the worlds.</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to investigate the corruption in Council and find the one who fractured the seal, Dalton is forced to participate in the Guardian Tournament, a spectacle that pits the highly-trained Guardians against one another in brutal battle for sport. Using the tournament as a distraction, the Elders of Council group the five strongest and most trustworthy Guardians into one team to infiltrate and flush out criminals within the Guardian Branch. Working with his teammates Eclipse, Mitoki, Hanyi, and Keito, Dalton is tasked with a mission of unimaginable magnitude--and one that has far-reaching repercussions.</p> <p>Dalton learns that this is not the first time the Guardian Tournament has been used as a distraction to the public. Forty years previous, a horrific massacre at the Guardian Tournament devastated the Dimension Protection Council. With the tournament in practice once again, there is the expectation that the same criminal responsible for the deaths of thousands is behind the unrest threatening the five worlds...and Dalton knows he has become the bait to lure him out of the shadows.</p> <p>Centuries-old secrets and hidden agendas bring the strongest Guardians to question their orders, their mission, and their own loyalty as they face an enemy more powerful than they could have ever believed.</p>";
