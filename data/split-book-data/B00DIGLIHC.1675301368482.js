window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Even today, the influence of Ancient Rome is indelible, with Europe and the world owing this extraordinary empire a huge cultural debt in almost every important category of human endeavor, including art, architecture, engineering, language, literature, law, and religion. At the peak of its power, Rome's span was vast. In the regional, restless, and shifting history of continental Europe, the Roman Empire stands as a towering monument to scale and stability, unified in politics and law, stretching from the sands of Syria to the moors of Scotland. And it stood for almost 700 years. </p> <p>In this series of 48 spirited lectures, you'll see how a small village of shepherds and farmers rose to tower over the civilized world of its day and left a permanent mark on history. In telling Rome's riveting story, Professor Fagan draws on a wealth of primary and secondary sources, including recent historical and archaeological scholarship, to introduce the fascinating tale of Rome's rise and decline, including the famous events and personalities that have become so familiar:</p> <ul> <li>Horatius at the bridge</li> <li>Hannibal crossing the Alps during Rome's life-or-death war with Carthage</li> <li>Caesar being assassinated before a statue of his archrival Pompey</li> <li>The doomed lovers Antony and Cleopatra</li> <li>The mad and venal emperors Nero and Caligula</li> <li>The conversion of Constantine.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The course also addresses one of history's greatest questions: Why did the Roman Empire fall? And you'll learn why most modern scholars believe that the empire did not \"fall\" at all, but, rather, changed into something very different - the less urbanized, more rural, early medieval world. </p>";
