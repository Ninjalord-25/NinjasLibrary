window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hello, friend, and welcome to Blade's Rest!</p> <p>Are you looking for a relaxing LitRPG where the world isn't ending every five minutes? Yes, I know that it's exciting to battle demons and loot swords. But sometimes it's nice to just build a town, drink beer, and end your day with a hearty bowl of stew, isn't it?</p> <p>Well, if you want a slice of life tale about a guy creating a town from scratch, then you came to the right place.</p> <p>Blade &amp; Sheath is a fully immersive VRMMORPG game where some folks complete quests, while others develop their magic and battle monsters.</p> <p>Then there are players like Josh.</p> <p>He needs to earn some cash, so when he gets a job as a town builder for Blade &amp; Sheath, he can't believe his luck. However, it won't be easy. The land he needs to build on is as untamed as the critters that prowl it. That's not all—he also starts with no skills and no resources.</p> <p>He does, however, have two fellow builders who will help him. Together they will build Blade's Rest—a place for adventurers to relax after a day of questing. Why not put down your sword, grab yourself a drink, and stay for a while and join them?</p>";
