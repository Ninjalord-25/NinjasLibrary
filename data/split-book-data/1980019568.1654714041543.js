window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>First in the new Assassins of Landria series from the award-winning, best-selling author of <i>Scourge: A Novel of Darkhurst</i>, and the Chronicles of the Necromancer books!</p> <p>Friends since their orphanage childhood, Joel “Ridge” Breckinridge and Garrett “Rett” Kennard rose through the ranks of the Landrian army together, from teenaged conscripts to seasoned fighters. Together, they became the most feared team of assassins in Landria, surviving longer that most in their profession by virtue of excellent fighting skills, legendary bravado, peerless strategy, and an uncanny synchronicity. Henri, their long-suffering squire, tends to the thankless jobs of provisioning and logistics, while Ridge and Rett fight and recover.&nbsp;</p> <p>When wandering mystic Yefim Makary becomes the darling of disenchanted aristocrats, Rett and Ridge fear Makary - or the Witch Lord, as his followers call him - is a threat to the crown. As treasonous whispers spread, Ridge and Rett go rogue to stop the threat, save the kingdom, and protect the king - while landing on the “Most Wanted” list themselves!</p>";
