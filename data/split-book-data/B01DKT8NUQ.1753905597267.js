When spring break begins at last, Xander plans to spend it playing computer games with his best friend, Peyton. Xander's father briefly distracts him with a comic book about some samurai warrior who pops out of a peach pit. Little does either boy know that the comic is a warning that they are about to be thrust into the biggest adventure of their lives. To win at this deadly serious game, they will have to rely on their wits, courage, faith, and especially each other. Maybe Xander should have listened to Mr. Stedman about the weather after all. </p>";
