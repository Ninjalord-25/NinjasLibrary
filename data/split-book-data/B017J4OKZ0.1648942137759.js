window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something is not right in Bayport. After a series of unfortunate (yet harmless) pranks, it looks like Frank and Joe have caught their suspect surprisingly early. Their classmate, Seth Diller, has taken his love of filmmaking a bit too far. But shortly after Frank and Joe confront Seth, there are fresh outbreaks of Seth-like pranks. Except these aren't as harmless. After a bit of investigating, the Hardy Boys uncover evidence of the Red Arrow - a group that will stop at nothing to bring chaos and crime to Bayport's peaceful existence. </p> <p>In the most dangerous case they have ever taken on, it's up to Frank and Joe to find the Red Arrow - before it finds them first. </p>";
