But who will take over for him? Twenty-nine apprentices have tried: some floundered, some fled, some failed to stay alive.</p> <p>Only Thomas Ward is left. He's the last hope; the last apprentice. Can Thomas succeed? Will he learn the difference between a benign witch and a malevolent one? Does the Spook's warning against girls with pointy shoes include Alice? And what will happen if Thomas accidentally frees Mother Malkin, the most evil witch in the county?</p>";
