window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A criminal mastermind creates violent tableaus in abandoned Detroit warehouses in Lauren Beukes's new genre-bending novel of suspense. </p> <p>Detective Gabriella Versado has seen a lot of bodies. But this one is unique even by Detroit's standards: half boy, half deer, somehow fused together. As stranger and more disturbing bodies are discovered, how can the city hold on to a reality that is already tearing at its seams? </p> <p>If you're Detective Versado's geeky teenage daughter, Layla, you commence a dangerous flirtation with a potential predator online. If you're desperate freelance journalist Jonno, you do whatever it takes to get the exclusive on a horrific story. If you're Thomas Keen, known on the street as TK, you'll do what you can to keep your homeless family safe - and find the monster who is possessed by the dream of violently remaking the world. </p> <p>If Lauren Beukes's internationally best-selling <i>The Shining Girls</i> was a time-jumping thrill ride through the past, her <i>Broken Monsters</i> is a genre-redefining thriller about broken cities, broken dreams, and broken people trying to put themselves back together again.</p>";
