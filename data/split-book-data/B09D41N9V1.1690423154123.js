window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ye screw with this lass, ye get put on yer ass.</p> <p>Life sucker-punched me.... I have family I didn't know about, a magical heritage laying its claim, and a mystery I apparently need to solve.</p> <p>There are three things I love most in life: my wild and crazy Irish family, Redbreast Whiskey at Shenanigans, and living in Toronto. Having grown up with five older brothers, I can fight my way out of most situations, either with my wicked sense of humor or my fists. Often both. But when a back-alley brawl leaves me marked with a bizarre Celtic crest on my back, I become a beacon for all things whacked and weird. My dad is obviously freaked when he sees the tat, but he won't discuss it. So, I do what any stubborn redheaded lass would - I ignore all advice and fly to the Emerald Isle to get answers.</p> <p>And yeah...you know that saying about hindsight being 20/20? True story.</p> <p>Look out, druid world. This mac Cumhaill is like no other.</p> <p>Will Fiona survive coming into her powers? Will those in Ireland survive Fiona? Can Toronto survive an urban druid and her mythical bear?</p>";
