window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Regan was a robotics scientist that caused the robot takeover of the world. When his last creation finally completes his plan to free himself, it destroys the world in the process. Destruction offers him a second chance to test his wits and cunning in another world. Now tasked with a goal that would upset the balance of a new world, Regan might be a bit more than the people of the world can handle.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an alternative retelling of the first Dungeon Robotics book: <i>Establish</i>. All the characters have been altered slightly, and there are new characters. Only the initial chapters have a resemblance to the first book and quickly change paths to a darker side of things.</p>";
