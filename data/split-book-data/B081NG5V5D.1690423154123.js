window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He once fought for his country. But does that qualify him to battle the zombie apocalypse?&nbsp;</p> <p>Verney County, Mississippi, 1980. Vietnam vet Bucky Dennis hit rock bottom and didn’t stop. Divorced, separated from his kids, and mourning the loss of his ‛69 Charger, he takes odd-jobs and pisses away cheap booze. And fate kicks him in the balls again when his latest gig traps him in close quarters with a bloodthirsty werewolf....</p> <p>By morning, Bucky manages to fight off the beast and is ready to obliterate the experience with more than a few drinks. But he’s pretty sure his hair of the dog shouldn’t come with a chaser of possessed honky-tonk piano, demented witches, and pint-sized vampires. If it’s not a nasty outbreak of bad luck, it may just be the end of the world.</p> <p>Can the tough-as-nails veteran kick zombies, bloodsuckers, and other supernatural sadists to kingdom come?</p> <p><i>The Gospel of Bucky Dennis</i> is the first scream worthy book in a horror comedy series. If you like zany action, hilarious heroes, and a double-shot of irreverent swearing, then you’ll love J. R. Parks’ sacred-cow-killing tale.</p> <p><b>Buy </b><b><i>The Gospel of Bucky Dennis </i></b><b>to punch the occult in the face today!</b></p>";
