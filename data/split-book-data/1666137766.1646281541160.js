window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"The arrival of the Prophetess will bring both hope and destruction for the wolves of the world. She alone will be able to save them - or damn them.\"</b></p> <p>The dark prophecy that has been passed down since the first pack of shifters is coming to fruition - and I am at the center of it. An orphaned human taken in by a pack of wolves. The fate of their existence in my hands.</p> <p>I've been treated as the dirt beneath the pack's paws for years. Will they be able to accept my new role when my powers surface? Will I be able to forgive them enough to help them?</p> <p>The bright spot amongst all the turmoil...finding my three fated. Until one of them rejects our bond. The one thing I know for sure...death is coming for us all, soon, and the person responsible for it? Their betrayal is going to alter the shifter world forever.</p> <p>I'll conquer my powers, protect the packs, and live happily ever after with my men, right? Wrong.</p> <p>No one is prepared for the vile truths of my visions to come to light.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
