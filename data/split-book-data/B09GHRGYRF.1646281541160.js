Every person...without exception.</b></p> <p>This new world, with all its opportunities and gifts of wondrous abilities, is a stadium, a deadly arena of an unimaginable scale, and all of humanity are its gladiators. Every man, woman, and child has been given a weapon and ordered to fight.</p> <p>Stuck in this dimension without a way out, only two options exist for the would-be hunters: Fight to complete the many trials ahead, or perish. Faced with hordes of powerful monsters, thrown into battle with complete strangers at random, it's an unfair game of survival.</p> <p>Billions of lives were extinguished in mere moments at the very beginning. But within this abyss of despair exists a small ray of hope: If even <i>one</i> person can complete every raid, humanity will be redeemed and restored back to its former glory. But there are no save points, no revives, no retries. Everyone has just one life to make their way through the gauntlet of raids prepared to test their mettle.</p> <p>And within this marathon of death, one man discovers an exception to the rules of the game....</p> <p><i>Translated by Oppatranslations.</i></p>";
