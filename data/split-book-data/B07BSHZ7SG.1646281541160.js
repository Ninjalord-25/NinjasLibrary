window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Witch's Reign...a land of unnatural hellish cold ruled over by the Ice Witch herself, who is in turn guarded by three creatures - Wolf, Bear, and Raven. Those lovely beasts derive their power directly from their mistress and just happen to kill any who cross their paths. To get there, you first must pass through the Dragon's Ground. Full of, you guessed it, dragons who for the record, also do not like trespassers.</p> <p>Sounds like a fun place to go, doesn't it?</p> <p>Yeah, not so much.</p> <p>You see the thing is my best friend, Darcy was sent with a team into the Witch's Reign to recover a powerful jewel that belongs to our mentor, and they are long overdue to come back.</p> <p>That leaves me, Zamira \"Reckless\" Wilson to go after my friend because no one else will.</p> <p>Somehow, I get saddled with a human - a male no less! - tagging along for the ride. A human that is as weak and useless as my shifting abilities.</p> <p>Throw in a weapon that might be trying to kill me, and a small dragon that has a penchant for Shakespearean insults, and you've got my life in a nutshell.</p> <p>May the sands of the desert swallow me whole because this is going to be a friggin bumpy ride.</p>";
