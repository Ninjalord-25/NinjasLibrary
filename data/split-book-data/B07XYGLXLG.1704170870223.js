Two years without their friend. New rumors speak to a possible location, and a crack team sets out to find Salem and bring him home. But does what they find even qualify as human?</p> <p>No sooner does Salem come home than he is visited by the Techkuza.

There, Salem encounters both familiar faces and a host of new enemies. His tenuous bonds of family, and his own mental stability, are tested beyond their limits. The events in Trinity Neon will not only change his life forever, but will also determine the fate of the world.</p> <p><i>One Piece at a Time</i> is a sprawling, heart-pounding, and heartbreaking adventure across deadly seas and into foreign lands that culminates in a moment all must experience. What happens when your best isn’t good enough?</p>";
