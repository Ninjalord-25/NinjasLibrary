I’m the author of this book, as well as many other better books that you may not have heard of. But this one is fine, I suppose—especially if you want to one day own a yacht.</p> <p>This is a story about three idiot wannabe detectives: J.J. and Valentine Watts and their new friend Trudi de la Rosa. Again, they’re idiots, but in a fun way where they go on adventures and occasionally use swear words. In this book, they’re riding a train on official Ghost Hunters Adventure Club business when an old friend from the past shows up to ruin everything. It’s up to our three young adventurers to solve the mystery of the Express Train to Nowhere before they’re locked away forever for a crime they didn’t even commit.</p> <p>There’s action, there’s humor, there’s suspense, but most importantly, there is a detailed set of instructions hidden within these minutes that will help both you and me get rich beyond our wildest dreams.</p> <p>Just buy the audiobook and start listening. You’ll learn everything about the Ghost Hunters Adventure Club and my personal get-rich-quick Yacht Plan soon.</p>";
