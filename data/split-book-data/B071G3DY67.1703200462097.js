That's what Finn's tribe believe. </p> <p>But when their settlement is massacred by a hostile tribe and Finn and several friends, companions, and rivals make their escape across a brutal, unfamiliar landscape, Finn will fight harder than he's ever fought in his life. He wants to live - even if he lives only long enough to tell Thyri Treelegs how he feels about her. </p> <p>The David Gemmell Award-nominated author of <i>Age of Iron</i> returns with <i>You Die When You Die</i>, in which a mismatched group of refugees battle animals and monsters, determined assassins, powerful tribes, an unforgiving land, and each other as they cross a continent to fulfill a prophecy. </p>";
