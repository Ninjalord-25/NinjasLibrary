Adopted as a pet by a princess, obtaining a soul and a mind, and being blessed by a caring family and doted on by powerful gods. </p> <p>Now, Jelly is accompanying Princess Liliana on her way to the Royal Varian Academy of Magic, where they both plan to learn more about the mystical arts. But not all is well, for a mad woman seeks the death of Varia's princess and will stop at nothing to ensure it happens. </p> <p>Add onto that new friends, bullies, and a prophecy, and Jelly has his tendrils full keeping the people he knows and loves safe. Plus, the Ooze has two new companions of his own to deal with and a rather eccentric mentor. In the end, can anyone truly stop the coming of the void? And will Jelly be the one to try? </p>";
