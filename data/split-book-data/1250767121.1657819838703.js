An over-promoted gangster.</p> <p>Merlin? An eldritch parasite.</p> <p>Excalibur? A shady deal with a watery arms dealer.</p> <p>Britain? A clogged sewer that Rome abandoned just as soon as it could.</p> <p>A savage and cutting epic fantasy, equally poetic and profane, <i>By Force Alone</i> is at once a timely political satire, a magical adventure, and a subversive masterwork.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books </b></p>";
