And it is Mary's disappearance that brought Ruth to Cranston House, a sinister, run-down hotel occupied by Dr. Eric Palmer and his youthful drug cultists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ruth is told that Mary is \"away for a while\". But no one will say where or for how long. Suddenly Ruth herself becomes a virtual prisoner. The more she learns about the dangerous drug experiments Palmer sponsors, the more terrified Ruth becomes. What really happened to Mary? And if Ruth finds out, will she suffer Mary's fate?</p>";
