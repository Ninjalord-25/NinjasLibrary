Even worse, after I came back, I still didn't get any cupcakes.</p> <p>What I did get, however, is a six-foot-something reaper with eyes like blue fire to guide me into the world of the supernatural. Which, as it turned out, wasn't quite like the fairy tales little girls are told growing up.</p> <p>Not only is magic real, more importantly, so are monsters. And apparently, I'm one of them.</p> <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself here. You see, four years ago, I left my hometown and swore to never come back.</p> <p>Now, my brother is dead, and I have no choice but to go searching for answers. Except finding them isn't easy when the secret society he belonged to is covering it up. I have to find out who killed him while watching my own back, because if I'm not careful, I might be next - and this time, there's no do-over. Luckily for me, Mr. Single and Hot as F--k is determined to help me keep my ass alive.</p> <p>I'm a lucky, lucky girl. Some days.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
