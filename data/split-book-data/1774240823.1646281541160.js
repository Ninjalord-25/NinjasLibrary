Cassandra, his temperamental trainer, tries to get him ready to battle Ghostpackers and Dreads, but it might be too little too late: for the first time in history, the Ash Angels are faltering against the fury of an evil more ancient than they are.</p> <p>While he fights to survive run-ins with a Sheid-hunted pop star and a gorgeous but dangerous Dread, Trace realizes his new life cannot erase the trauma of the old. Thrust onto the front lines of a violent war with ancient ambition, Trace finds that the deadliest demons are the ones lurking in his own mind.</p>";
