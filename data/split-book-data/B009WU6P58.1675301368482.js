As they become more aware of their aunts' mysterious and sometimes frightening powers - and as their own powers begin to surface - the sisters grow determined to escape their strange upbringing by blending into \"normal\" society. </p> <p>But both find that they cannot elude their magic-filled past. And when trouble strikes - in the form of a menacing backyard ghost - the sisters must not only reunite three generations of Owens women but embrace their magic as a gift - and their key to a future of love and passion. </p> <p>Funny, haunting, and shamelessly romantic, <i>Practical Magic</i> is bewitching entertainment - Alice Hoffman at her spectacular best.</p>";
