With the help of his berserker fairy friend, he may need to prevent an unholy union between ancient demons and the walking dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Damian has one chance to stop his sister and ruin the wedding before one hell of an afterparty dooms the world.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Days Gone Bad</i> is the first book in the savagely funny Vesik urban fantasy series.
