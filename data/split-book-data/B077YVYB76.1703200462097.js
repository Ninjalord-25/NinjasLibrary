window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most people have heard of voodoo before, but if you think it only has to do with sticking pins into cursed dolls for the purpose of inflicting pain onto your enemies, you couldn’t be further from the truth.</p> <p>Voodoo, or <i>vodou</i> as it is traditionally referred to, is a modern-day take on an ancient Haitian religion developed by African-Caribbean slave workers on island plantations during the period of French slavery. Apart from simply being just a religion, voodoo is actually an entire way of life centered around an immense respect for one's elders. This respect is further expanded towards life philosophies and spirituality, and even extends into the realm of a great respect for nature.</p> <p>This audiobook is designed to introduce you to the very essence of voodoo. After you have prepared yourself both mentally and physically to perform voodoo spells and rituals, you will learn how to put into practice a very basic voodoo spell and protection charm.</p> <p>While you're going through this audiobook, it's important to keep in mind that within the practice of voodoo, everyone is part of the same order. So with a little bit of hard work and dedication, you too can master the art of voodoo and reap the countless benefits that come with it.</p>";
