But as a recently promoted MagiPol agent, I love it significantly less than that guy.</p> <p>Especially when the life of a kidnapped teen hangs in the balance.</p> <p>Between confusing orders and conflicting evidence, this whole investigation has me and my partner, Lienna, spinning in circles. Why is our boss keeping this case off the books? Why is our top suspect, the most notorious rogue in Vancouver, mired in contradictions? And why am I the only one who cares more about the victim than their own ulterior motives?</p> <p>Everyone wants me to shut up and follow orders, but that's not my style. I'll do whatever it takes to save this kid - even if that means returning to my roguish roots.</p>";
