But the story disagreed.</p> <p>Still trapped inside the fantasy he believes he created, Bruce has survived monsters, magical systems, and the awkwardness of being mistaken for Carpathian Einzgear, the dead hero hekilled off. But as Bruce begins to repair the damage Carpathian left behind, he'll discover something worse than a corrupted plotline: a world he can no longer control.</p> <p>The System is glitching. And there may be more to his story than Bruce realizes. Meanwhile, the group of soul-bonded allies he never meant to abandon—his Heart Guard—is beginning to come undone.</p> <p>Now, Bruce must confront the cost of every word he wrote . . . and all the ones he didn't. Because the enemies rising against him aren't just monsters or cults or angry wizards. They're consequences.</p> <p><i>Meet Your Maker Volume 2</i> is the continuation of a series that blends epic fantasy, absurdist comedy, and metafictional mayhem in a story about authorship, accountability, and the people who keep believing in you even when you stop believing in yourself.</p>";
