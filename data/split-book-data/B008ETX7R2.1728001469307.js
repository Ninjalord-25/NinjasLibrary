window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first in an alternate fantasy series where vampires, werewolves, and goblins rule London. </b></p> <p>Queen Victoria rules with an immortal fist. The undead matriarch presides over a Britain where the Aristocracy is made up of werewolves and vampires, where goblins live underground and mothers know better than to let their children out after dark. It's a world where the nobility are infected with the Plague (side-effects include undeath), Hysteria is the popular affliction of the day, and leeches are considered a delicacy. And a world where technology lives side by side with magic.&nbsp;</p> <p>The year is 2012 and Pax Britannia still reigns.</p> <p>Xandra Vardan is a member of the elite Royal Guard, and it is her duty to protect the Aristocracy. But when her sister goes missing, Xandra will set out on a path that undermines everything she believed in and uncover a conspiracy that threatens to topple the empire. And she is the key - the prize - in a very dangerous struggle.</p> <p>The fantastic start to The Immortal Empire series that continues with the spectacular undead books, <i>The Queen is Dead </i>and <i>Long Live the Queen</i>.&nbsp;</p>";
