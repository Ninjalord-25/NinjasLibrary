Nick Gautier was born to bring about the end of the world.... </p> <p>It's not easy being the heir of a demon overlord. But in <i>Invision</i>, Nick is determined to thwart his destiny and get into a good college. To be more than his genetics and prophecy foretell. </p> <p>No one is ever going to tell this stubborn Cajun who and what he really is. Or how to live his life. Not even the Fates of the Universe. But now that he and his team of ancient gods and demons have claimed the Eye of Ananke and he sees the missteps of the future, he has to battle the demons within, which are far deadlier and more treacherous than any he's battled before. All the while his archnemesis is back and determined to reclaim his place as the harbinger of Armageddon. Even if it means killing Nick and barbecuing everyone he loves to do so. </p>";
