Roan Parrish conjures real darkness here. Highly recommended!” (Jonathan Maberry, <i>NY Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Ink</i> and <i>V-Wars</i>)</p> <p>\"These are the queer horror stories I've been waiting for.\" (Kirsty Logan, author of <i>The Things We Say in the Dark </i>and <i>The Sound at the End</i>)</p>";
