window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Middle-aged. Divorced. Hormonally imbalanced. Then she got magic.<br> Underestimate her. That’ll be fun.</b></p> <p>My best friend got tangled up with some vamps and now she’s missing. As if that wasn’t scary enough, I snapped, and in a cold dark rage, unleashed a rare and powerful shadow magic. So, I won’t be having that second date, but in all fairness, he got what he deserved. My only regret is that I may have put a target on me and my kid. I’ll fix it, that’s what moms do.</p> <p>Now, with only a mouthy golem and a grumpy-yet-sexy French wolf shifter to help me navigate this world of hidden magic, I’m in a race against time to rescue my friend and keep my loved ones safe from the skeletons in my past.</p> <p>Sure, I’m caught in a spiderweb of supernatural power plays, but I’m a librarian, I’m over 40, and I’m definitely done with being sidelined in my own life. If anyone can survive this dangerous adventure, it’s me. New to-do list: kick butt and rediscover the woman who got lost along the way....</p> <p>I’m turning my invisibility into strength; they’ll never see me coming.</p> <p><i>Throwing Shade</i> features a sassy, slow burn romance, and is perfect for fans of K.F. Breene, Darynda Jones, and Shannon Mayer. Get it now!&nbsp;</p>";
