window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Monster girls, divine magic, and a frontier of dungeons to tame. </b></p> <p>William Adams hoped to escape his dead-end life by reconnecting with estranged friends. They died when a floating cuboid interrupted the gaming night and vaporized everyone. Waking with powers reminiscent of his paladin character, William finds himself alone in a fantasy frontier of dungeoneers, desperadoes, and damsels of the monster girl varieties.&nbsp;</p> <p>Set on reuniting with his friends, William accepts the duties of a Frontier Ranger. Unfortunately, the job is a ticket to a lifetime of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>Local ruffians, a laser golem-infested dungeon, and enemies from the deep seas force the former mall cop to stretch his magic of divine blessings to its limits. Thankfully, William has a nerdy faun archeologist and a psychic aboleth princess by his side. Together they explore the hidden mysteries of the Cursed Frontier.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ruinland Ranger<i> contains explicit engagements between a monster girl harem and the main character.</i></p>";
