window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This collection of 18 short tales, a novelette, and a short novel takes the listener inside the dark imagination of Elizabeth Engstrom, author of acclaimed horror classics like <i>When Darkness Loves Us</i>.</p> <p>In these stories, you will hear about a woman asked to be complicit in her own mother’s death, a grandmother with a macabre hobby, a bizarre, phallic-shaped flower that portends evil for a married couple, a father whose son is caught up in a sinister government experiment. These are weird and unsettling tales that will linger with the listener.</p> <p>In her introduction to this new edition, Lisa Kröger declares, “There are true horrors that await readers in all of Engstrom’s works...reminds me of another giant of horror literature, Shirley Jackson.”</p>";
