window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meet the Necromancer Cult’s newest, sleepiest, and least qualified recruit: Momo Lim.</p> <p>As an anti-social art major perpetually at risk of dropping out, college life wasn't a great fit for Momo. When she wakes up one morning in a dark cavern full of sentient skeletons and oddball introverts who call themselves necromancers, she knows a new era of her life is about to start.</p> <p>Chosen for her meek and harmless personality, she is able to exist under the radar as she completes the Dawn's necromantic missions. Watch her as she gains confidence (and class levels), and reluctantly rises from meager apprentice to self-assured queen of the underworld.</p> <p>Dive into a lighthearted and humorous (but epic!) isekai LitRPG, with a vivid world full of characters for Momo to meet, battle, bemuse, and most importantly—bring back from the dead.</p> <p>Narrated by Anjali Bhimani, best known for voicing Symmetra in Overwatch and Rampart in Apex Legends, as well as acting in Ms. Marvel and Critical Role.</p>";
