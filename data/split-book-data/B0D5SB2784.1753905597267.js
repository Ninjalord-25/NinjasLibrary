Even if it means taking out a few loans.</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, his new teacher sees him more as a tool than a student. He has set Malachi near-impossible goals before he becomes worthy of Orykson's full attention, and Malachi's innate power is only somewhat above average.</p> <p>Worse, it turns out that Orykson has enemies more powerful than Malachi had ever imaginedâ€”and now their attention has landed solidly on him.</p> <p>Torn between the mage who can offer him everything, and a strange old woman who offers him the chance to guide his own path, Malachi is left scrambling to find his purpose as a new mage.</p> <p><i>You can expect slow-burn to power, slice-of-life, and queer content.</i></p>";
