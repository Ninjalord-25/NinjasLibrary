window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Another virtuoso blend of horror, action, and humor. . . . Fans will find this a worthy sequel.”—</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p> <p><b>In this thrilling adventure, a blend of enthralling historical fiction and fantastical horror, Matt Ruff returns to the world of </b><b><i>Lovecraft Country</i></b><b> and explores the meaning of death, the hold of the past on the present, and the power of hope in the face of uncertainty.</b></p> <p>Summer, 1957. Atticus Turner and his father, Montrose, travel to North Carolina to mark the centennial of their ancestor’s escape from slavery, but an encounter with an old nemesis leads to a life-and-death pursuit.</p> <p>Back in Chicago, George Berry is diagnosed with cancer and strikes a devil’s bargain with the ghost of Hiram Winthrop, who promises a miracle cure—but only if George brings Winthrop back from the dead.</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Horace Berry, reeling from the killing of a close friend, joins his mother, Hippolyta, and her friend Letitia Dandridge on a trip to Nevada for <i>The Safe Negro Travel Guide. </i>But Hippolyta has a secret—and far more dangerous—agenda that will take her and Horace to the far end of the universe and bring a new threat home to Letitia’s doorstep.</p> <p>Hippolyta isn’t the only one keeping secrets. Letitia’s sister, Ruby, has been leading a double life as her white alter ego, Hillary Hyde. Now, the supply of magic potion she needs to transform herself is nearly gone, and a surprise visitor throws her already tenuous situation into complete chaos.</p> <p>Yet these troubles are soon eclipsed by the return of Caleb Braithwhite. Stripped of his magic and banished from Chicago at the end of <i>Lovecraft Country</i>, he’s found a way back into power and is ready to pick up where he left off. But first he has a score to settle . . .</p>";
