window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Carson High School seniors Scott and Davey don't have much common ground - that is, until all universes begin collapsing into their school. Soon the avowed loner and the mean-girl cheerleader realize that something is very wrong, and they're the only two who are aware of what's happening. Demon versions of their teachers roam the halls, a cowboy sloth appears sporadically, and some students randomly burst into flames while angry interdimensional counterparts of other students destroy everything in sight. </p><p>Now it's up to two seniors from opposite sides of the social spectrum to defeat this scourge and save not only their high school but also the world. Armed with little more than school supplies and Scott's trusty copy of <i>The NEW Multiverse Theory</i>, can these unlikely heroes put their differences aside and stop the total chaos? If they can't, the end of the world may just be beginning. </p>";
