window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2024 Audie Award Winner for Literary Fiction &amp; Classics</b></p> <p>When Emily Wilson’s translation of <i>The Odyssey</i> appeared in 2017―rendering the ancient poem in contemporary language that was “fresh, unpretentious and lean” (Madeline Miller, <i>Washington Post</i>)―critics lauded it as “a revelation” (Susan Chira, <i>New York Times</i>) and “a cultural landmark” (Charlotte Higgins, <i>Guardian</i>) that would forever change how Homer is read in English. Now Wilson has returned with an equally revelatory translation of Homer’s other great epic―the most revered war poem of all time.</p> <p>Brought to life in vivid audio form, this crisp verse translation of <i>The Iliad</i> roars with the clamor of arms, the bellowing boasts of victors, the fury and grief of loss, and the anguished cries of dying men. It sings, too, of the sublime magnitude of the world―the fierce beauty of nature and deities’ grand schemes beyond the ken of mortals.</p> <p>Wilson’s musical iambic pentameter verse is brought to life in the evocative voice of narrator and Broadway legend Audra McDonald. In her thrilling reading, this magical and often horrifying tale gallops at a pace befitting its legendary battle scenes. The culmination of a decade of intense engagement with antiquity’s most surpassingly beautiful and emotionally complex poetry, Wilson’s <i>Iliad</i> now gives us a complete Homer for our generation.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
