Now Varney serves as personal chef to his new master: a thief, child abductor, and murderer by the name of Viral.</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to gain power and build an empire, Viral steals two items from the Adventurer’s Guild. One that allows him to leave the fragment moments after it impacts Earth, and another that secures him his very own personal chef.</p> <p>On the run from the guild and hounded by quickly manifesting monsters, Viral, Varney, and 10 orphans are forced to flee into a dungeon. A dungeon that just so happens to be composed entirely of food matter. Trapped in the food dungeon, and with his enemies closing in from all sides, Varney concocts a treacherous plan to betray Viral and seize the villain's power for himself.</p>";
