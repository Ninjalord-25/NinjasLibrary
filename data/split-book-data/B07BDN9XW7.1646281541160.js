window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b> <b>best-selling author and master of horror Stephen King teams up with Bev Vincent of</b> <b><i>Cemetery Dance</i></b> <b>to present a terrifying collection of 16 short stories (and one poem) that tap into one of King’s greatest fears - air travel - featuring brand-new stories by King and Joe Hill,</b> <b>“an expertly compiled collection of tales that entertain and scare” (</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b>).</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Stephen King hates to fly, and he and co-editor Bev Vincent would like to share their fear of flying with you.&nbsp;</p> <p>Welcome to <i>Flight or Fright</i>, an anthology about all the things that can go horribly wrong when you’re suspended six miles in the air, hurtling through space at more than 500 mph, and sealed up in a metal tube (like - gulp! - a coffin) with hundreds of strangers. Here are all the ways your trip into the friendly skies can turn into a nightmare, including some we’ll bet you’ve never thought of before... but now you will the next time you walk down the jetway and place your fate in the hands of a total stranger.&nbsp;</p> <p>Featuring brand-new “standouts” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) by Joe Hill and Stephen King, as well as 14 classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Dan Simmons, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and many others, <i>Flight or Fright</i> is, as King says, “ideal airplane reading, especially on stormy descents…Even if you are safe on the ground, you might want to buckle up nice and tight.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Each story is introduced by Stephen King and all will have you thinking twice about how you want to reach your final destination.&nbsp;</p>";
