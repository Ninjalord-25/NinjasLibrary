Broadly labeled <i>yōkai</i>, they appear in many forms, from <i>tengu</i> mountain goblins and <i>kappa</i> water sprites, to shape-shifting <i>kitsune</i> foxes and long-tongued ceiling-lickers. Popular today in anime, manga, film, and video games, many yōkai originated in local legends, folktales, and regional ghost stories. <i>The Book of Yōkai</i> invites listeners to examine how people create, transmit, and collect folklore, and how they make sense of the mysteries in the world around them.</p> <p>Revised and expanded, this second edition features fifty new illustrations, including an all-new yōkai gallery of stunning color images tracing the visual history of yōkai across centuries. In clear and accessible language, Michael Dylan Foster unpacks the cultural and historical contexts of yōkai, interpreting their varied meanings and introducing people who have pursued them through the ages.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
