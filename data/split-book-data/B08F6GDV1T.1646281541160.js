window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One sassy pyromaniac thief, three sexy-as-sin monsters, and a paranormal conspiracy of epic proportions.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was an ordinary job. Another night, another asshole collector of the supernatural. I free some poor little beasties from their cages, pocket a few trinkets to pay my bills, and burn the place down on my way out. Just call me the Robin Hood of monster emancipation.&nbsp;</p> <p>I didn’t count on three manly monsters following me home like lost puppies. Stunningly hot lost puppies, but still. Now I’ve got a seductively cheeky incubus, a sweetly enthusiastic demon, and a grimly stoic angel camped out in my kitchen. They’re determined to repay me for my help, and they won’t get out of my apartment until they’re satisfied we’re even.&nbsp;</p> <p>To be fair, they’ve got no place else to go. A covert band of hunters captured their boss, and the trail is ice-cold. I’ll lend a hand if it means I can send them on their way...and when it looks like we’re up against the same creeps who murdered the person I loved most, you’d better believe I’m all in.&nbsp;</p> <p>Track down the baddies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Steal back the boss.&nbsp;</p> <p>Don’t get killed along the way.&nbsp;</p> <p>Oh, and maybe hook up with a monstrous hottie or two.&nbsp;</p> <p>Piece of cake.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m so going to regret this.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Shadow Thief</i> is the first book in a new reverse harem urban fantasy series. If you love kickass heroines with sass to spare, drool-worthy monsters with their own sense of morality, and steamy romances where there'll be no choosing required, dive in now!</p>";
