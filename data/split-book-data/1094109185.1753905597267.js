window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The most spine-tingling suspense stories from the colonial era - including Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James, and H. P. Lovecraft</b></p> <p>This stunning anthology of classic colonial suspense fiction plunges deep into the native soil from which American horror literature first sprang. While European writers of the Gothic and bizarre evoked ruined castles and crumbling abbeys, their American counterparts looked back to the colonial era’s stifling religion, and its dark and threatening woods.</p> <p>Today, the best-known tale of colonial horror is Washington Irving’s <i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>, although Irving’s story is probably best known today from various movie versions it has inspired. Colonial horror tales of other prominent American authors - Nathaniel Hawthorne and James Fenimore Cooper among them - are overshadowed by their best sellers and are difficult to find in modern libraries. Many other pioneers of American horror fiction are presented afresh in this breathtaking volume for today’s public listeners.</p> <p>Some will have heard the names of Increase and Cotton Mather in association with the Salem witch trials but will not have sought out their contemporary accounts of what were viewed as supernatural events. By bringing these writers to the attention of the contemporary listeners, this collection will help bring their names - and their work - back from the dead.</p>";
