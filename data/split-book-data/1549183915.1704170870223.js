window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A father searching for his missing daughter is suddenly given hope when a major clue is discovered, but learning the truth could shatter the seemingly perfect image Hollywood is desperate to uphold. </b></p> <p>Gates Foster lost his daughter, Lucy, 17 years ago. He's never stopped searching. Suddenly, a shocking new development provides Foster with his first major lead in over a decade, and he may finally be on the verge of discovering the awful truth.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mitzi Ives has carved out a space among the Foley artists creating the immersive sounds giving Hollywood films their authenticity. Using the same secret techniques as her father before her, she's become an industry-leading expert in the sound of violence and horror, creating screams so bone-chilling, they may as well be real.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soon Foster and Ives find themselves on a collision course that threatens to expose the violence hidden beneath Hollywood's glamorous fa√ßade. A grim and disturbing reflection on the commodification of suffering and the dangerous power of art, <i>The Invention of Sound </i>is Chuck Palahniuk at the peak of his literary powers - his most suspenseful, most daring, and most genre-defying work yet.</p>";
