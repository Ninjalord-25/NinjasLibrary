It's a hot new look for me - literally, because it bursts into flames whenever I'm threatened.&nbsp;</p> <p>My magical makeover is all Gary's fault. I knew there was something off from the moment he transferred to my school. Go figure. He's a wizard with a trust fund and an inferiority complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, thanks to him, I've graduated from high school bullies to supernatural terrors and that's not all. Fate has chosen me to face the legendary vampire destined to destroy the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>If I want to survive, I'll have to dig deep and discover whether I'm truly worthy of this new power. Because if not, everything I hold dear will soon burn even hotter than my hair.</p>";
