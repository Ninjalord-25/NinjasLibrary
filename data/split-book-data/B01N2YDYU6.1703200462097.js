window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Crown Prince Aven Lanuken wants something more than a trophy for a future wife. He wants a woman who will be more friend than follower. A queen who will be more warrior than diplomat. He wants a partner he can trust...with a dangerous secret that's kept him trapped in a dark mountain fortress his entire life. </p> <p>Mage slave Miara wants something more, too - to find an enemy prince. And not to marry him. She's just received orders for her very first kidnapping. She loathes the idea of it, and it's probably a suicide mission. But she has never failed a mission before and doesn't intend to start now. </p> <p>Of all the women in the world, why does he have to fall for the one trying to kill him? </p> <p>Magic, politics, love, and fate collide in the destinies of two people in this fantasy adventure from R. K. Thorne. For lovers of swords and sorcery with a side of romance, <i>Mage Slave</i> is the first novel in the Enslaved Chronicles trilogy. </p>";
