window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I wouldn’t say my life is a dumpster fire — but it’s far from typical. I’m frenemies with the local werewolves’ Alpha, my clients are shady as hell, and my magic falls firmly in the WTF category. Mephisto, my mysterious and powerful client, is more interested in my magic than the jobs he’s hired me for. And I’m pretty sure my court-ordered therapist thinks I’m an ass.&nbsp;</p> <p>Maybe it’s not a dumpster fire, but it <i>is</i> a hot mess.&nbsp;</p> <p>That said, I’m good at my job. Anytime a curse goes wrong, a magical object is lost, or a rogue supernatural needs apprehending, I’m the person you call.&nbsp;</p> <p>My new assignment is supposed to be simple: Just find a coveted magical object. Instead my client is abducted, I’m pulled into the underbelly of the magical world, and a spell is cast on me that reveals a mark of the raven.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now I’m being hunted by the people I used to hunt. I’ve piqued the interest of the magical elite. And I don’t know who wants me as an ally and who wants me dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>I <i>have</i> to fix this.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because if I don’t, I won’t survive.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Are you looking for a unique story with an anti-hero to hero character arc?
