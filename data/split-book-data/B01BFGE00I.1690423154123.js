window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the voice of authority calls, Tony Hawkin assumes there is a glitch. After all, why would the nation possibly require the services of a man who runs the gift shop in the FBI building? But there's no mistake, and soon Tony finds himself in the middle of Mexico, pursued by a ruthless killer, and hot on the trail of a priceless work of art. He has to find the painting, determine its authenticity, and return it safely to Washington. There's only one problem: everybody wants this particular painting. Now Tony must summon all his wits and courage to outsmart the forces of international espionage - tracking down the painting was easy, escaping the clutches of the KGB, the Mafia and Mossad is more than he bargained for. And then there's the man, the one with a predilection for guns and sharp knives. Suddenly, all Tony can think of is the warm comfort of his shop in DC, and the sound of small voices: \"Hey, mister, how much for the chocolate handcuffs?\" Will he ever see those little faces.... </p>";
