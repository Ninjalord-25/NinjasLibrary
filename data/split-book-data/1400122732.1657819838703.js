The \"Beast Princess\", as Aless is known by courtiers, confidently sets her mind to ways of making peace, but her father has already decided for her: She is to marry one of the mysterious and monstrous dark-elves to forge a treaty. While she intends to preserve the peace, the Beast Princess has plans of her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Prince Veron has been raised knowing his life is not his own, but to be bargained away by his mother, the queen of Nozva Rozkveta, to strengthen the dark-elf queendom. When his mother tells him he is to marry a self-absorbed, vile human, he is determined to do his duty regardless of his personal feelings. After arriving at the human capital, he finds the \"Beast Princess\" rebellious and untamed - and not to be trusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Aless and Veron face opposition at every turn, with humans and dark-elves alike opposing the union violently. Can two people from cultures that despise one another fall in love? Can a marriage between them bond two opposing worlds together, or will it tear them apart for good?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
