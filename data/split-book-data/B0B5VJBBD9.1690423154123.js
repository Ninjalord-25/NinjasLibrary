window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Welcome to the thrilling conclusion of Robert W. Ross' award-winning Sentinels of Creation series.</b></p> <p>For the past seven years, Kellan Caufield Thorne has been caught up in a celestial power play of epic proportions. The final act began in an Atlanta alley by forever removing the scales from Kellan’s eyes to reveal a world of Creation, Destruction, gods, angels, demons, and Mantles. Now the last scene begins to unfold as God’s unchecked hand on the world must traverse a perilous and narrow path if he has any hope of saving our universe from Perditor, the very incarnation of destruction.</p> <p>Join Kellan, Shannon, and their allies as the Sentinel and his Soulborn wife cross oceans of time to meet five Mantles of immense power. Duty, War, Honor, Sacrifice, and Justice each have a gift to bestow, but only if Kellan can complete the trials they will set before him. At the beginning of time, these five were entrusted with a fragment of God’s one true name.</p> <p>If Kellan can prove himself worthy, each fragment will be inscribed deep within the Sentinel’s heart. Should he complete all five of the Mantles’ trials, Kellan’s heart will contain unimaginable power, but such power can only be used at an equally unimaginable cost.</p> <p>Old loyalties and covenants begin to shift or shatter as Perditor extends his influence into our world, corrupting some, and enticing others. The Sentinel of Order has been transformed by by trials, tribulations, friendships, and love. He has been honed by the whetstone of adversity, tempered by a burden of chaos, and quenched in the love of a Soulborn.</p> <p>As the end of all things approaches, the universe holds its breath, waiting to see if Kellan Thorne is prepared to offer a final sacrifice.</p>";
