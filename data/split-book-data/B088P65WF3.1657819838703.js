window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I always thought the gods were a myth. Then again, I thought the same thing about witches.&nbsp;</p> <p>I'm no stranger to darkness. I've been dealing with it all my life. That's just part of being a \"mutant psychic\". I see things and know things that I'd be better off not seeing or knowing. But when my witch powers start to manifest, my life takes on a new direction entirely. Suddenly, I’m recruited by the Shadow Order, a supernatural agency dedicated to the protection of the covens. My primary task? To read supernatural crime scenes. Trust me, at that point the word “dark” takes on a whole new meaning.</p> <p>When one of those crime scenes opens a door between me and three goddesses hunting for a talisman, I seriously start to reconsider my life choices. Especially when those same goddesses start hunting for me. And when I meet an irresistibly alluring stranger who seems to know me better than I do, I really have to wonder. Because if what he tells me is true, I too carry the blood of the gods in my veins, and only I can unlock the magic needed to save the human race.</p>";
