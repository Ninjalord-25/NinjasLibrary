window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is a combo of two books in this series:&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Book 1:</b> Together with her cat, Binx, Cassandra has moved into a nice beach town on the west coast. It doesn’t take long, however, before she finds herself lucky enough (if you could call it that) to discover a dead body in the water. As she gets to know more people and teams up with a detective, she feels more and more drawn to the investigation of what seems to be a murder with an elaborate story behind it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Suspects are questioned, suspicious individuals pursued, and funny anecdotes to her witch powers are prevalent throughout the entire event. Slowly but surely, the truth about the motives, methods, and future plans of the murderers unravel, and Cassandra figures out a way to help catch the perpetrators.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Book 2: </b>After the beach life, Cassandra retreats to the woods and focuses on a quiet camping experience that gets disrupted by a missing teenager. When she comes across the detective investigating the case, she can’t seem to wonder why his wife is so weird and so obsessed with other people’s bodies. However, as the investigation continues, she bumps into various other shady characters. The pool of suspects becomes bigger and bigger. Will she be able to figure out what happened to the poor teenager who is missing?&nbsp;</p> <p>Don’t wait and begin listening now!</p>";
