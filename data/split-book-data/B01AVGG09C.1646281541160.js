window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The battle against evil has begun in this \"devishly entertaining\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) story of a suburban neighborhood in the grip of surreal terror - a number-one national best seller from Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman. </p> <p>Peaceful suburbia on Poplar Street in Wentworth, Ohio, takes a turn for the ugly when four vans containing armed \"regulators\" terrorize the street's residents, cold-bloodedly killing anyone foolish enough to step outside their homes. Houses mysteriously transform into log cabins, and the street now ends in what looks like a child's hand-drawn Western landscape. Masterminding this sudden onslaught is the evil creature Tak, who has taken over the body of an autistic eight-year-old boy, Seth Garin. </p> <p>\"A rip-roaringly violent thriller whose main action takes place in little more than an hour and a half\" (<i>Booklist</i>), <i>The Regulators</i> features an introduction by Stephen King on \"The Importance of Being Bachman\". </p>";
