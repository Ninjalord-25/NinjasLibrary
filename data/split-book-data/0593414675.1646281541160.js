window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The long-awaited war has come in the sweeping conclusion to the Lot Lands trilogy - another irresistibly swashbuckling, swaggering, foul-mouthed fantasy</b> <b>from the author of </b><b><i>The Grey Bastards</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>“[A] rip-roaring, shelf-bending conclusion...nothing short of an adventure fantasy masterwork.” (</b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b>, Best Books of the Year)</b></p> <p>War has come to the Lot Lands - and Oats stands upon the frontline.</p> <p>The Hisparthan armies on the horizon are mighty, bolstered by divine champions, dread sorcerers, and gunpowder. It’s almost more than the half-orc rebellion can hope to repel.</p> <p>But Oats has won impossible fights before. He’s a thriceblood, after all, more orc than man. And he hasn’t forgotten how to kill. He’ll stack the bodies high for his chief and his brethren, if that’s the price of freeing the Lots from human tyranny.</p> <p>Besides, the invading forces are getting a damned sight more than they bargained for. They’re not facing a handful of half-orc hoofs, but a true army - one forged from all the peoples of the Lots. At its head are Fetching, in full command of the ruinous power that runs through her veins, and Jackal, armed with the blessings of a dead god.</p> <p>Yet Oats can’t help but find his faith wavering. Once the strongest Bastard, he soon realizes that in this battle, even the strength of a thriceblood is easily conquered. And after a grievous loss strikes, he begins to fear that this war will lead the Lots not to freedom but to ruin.</p> <p>So when another path to peace beckons, he has no choice but to walk it. Even if it means betting the Lots’ fate, and his own, on the promises of the Bastards’ wiliest adversary - and making a perilous journey into the heart of Hispartha itself.</p> <p>Brimming with all the epic battles, surprising sorcery, and fiendish twists a Bastards fan could wish for, alongside unforgettable moments for characters old and new,<i> The Free Bastards </i>builds a new future for the Lots - even as it gives our beloved trio of Jackal, Fetching, and Oats the rousing, blood-soaked sendoff they deserve.</p>";
