window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Dude, Bro</i> is a humorous guide to surviving college written by comedian Bread Foster. <i>Dude, Bro</i> will provide articles, episodes, and truth (under the guise of guidance) about college life, mixed with honest stories from a mildly psychotic student. After extensive discussions with fellow college students who were part of his college experience, the most frequently uttered phrase was, \"How did we survive that?\" and Bread wants to teach future bros how. </p><p><i>Dude, Bro</i> will allow the listener to get a moral out of a story where morals are neither black nor white. The objective is to provide an honest experience from a lower-middle class author who went crazy at a state university. <i>Dude, Bro</i> will have a sense of humor because college itself is kind of a joke. </p>";
