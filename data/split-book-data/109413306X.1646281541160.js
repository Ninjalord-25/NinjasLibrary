Amongst&nbsp;these is Lt. Benjamin Braddock, survivor of&nbsp;the&nbsp;massacre that ended&nbsp;the&nbsp;war, and begrudgingly ready to return to a world that, well, doesn't seem to need him any more than it did in peacetime. His friends have homes and families to return to, while he's got nothing but his discharge papers and a couple of unwanted medals. Oh, and one new thing:&nbsp;the&nbsp;furious ghost of his commanding officer.</p> <p>Fortunately, since&nbsp;the&nbsp;officer's family is so vehemently adamant that Braddock join&nbsp;their rich and carefree fold, he doesn't have much time to fret about being haunted. But&nbsp;the&nbsp;secrets of&nbsp;the&nbsp;war are about to catch up to&nbsp;them all.</p>";
