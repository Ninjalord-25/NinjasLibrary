window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“A contemporary novel of masterful horror replete with magic, fantasy, and more than a little stylish sensuality.” (</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Phil Hastings was a lucky man - he had money, a growing reputation as a screenwriter, a happy, loving family with three kids, and he'd just moved into the house of his dreams in rural of magic - and about to be altered irrevocably by a magic more real than any he dared imagine. For with the Magic came the Bad Thing, and the Faerie, and then the Fool...and the resurrection of a primordial war with a forgotten People - a war that not only the Hastings but the whole human race could lose.</p> <p>“Absorbing, thought-provoking, and thoroughly magical. Feist's skillfully crafted prose illuminates many of the darker sides of fairy stories.... Try it as a bedtime story...but only on nights when you can take some time getting to sleep.” (<i>The West Coast Review of Books</i>)</p>";
