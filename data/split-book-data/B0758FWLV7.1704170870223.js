window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A sweeping historical saga that traces five generations of fiercely powerful mothers and daughters - witches whose magical inheritance is both a dangerous threat and an extraordinary gift.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Brittany, 1821.</i> After Grand-mere Ursule gives her life to save her family, their magic seems to die with her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even so, the Orchires fight to keep the old ways alive, practicing half-remembered spells and arcane rites in hopes of a revival. And when their youngest daughter comes of age, magic flows anew. The lineage continues, though new generations struggle not only to master their power, but also to keep it hidden.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when World War II looms on the horizon, magic is needed more urgently than ever - not for simple potions or visions, but to change the entire course of history.&nbsp;</p>";
