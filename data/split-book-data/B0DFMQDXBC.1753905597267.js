Though he dutifully posts reviews on his blog, he's never been able to recreate his brief moment of viral popularity, and his trickling income isn't enough to pay rent next month.</p> <p>Driving home from a roadside diner, Denver witnesses a UFO explode directly over his tiny town of Muddy Gap. When he questions his neighbors, it appears that Denver is the only person to have seen anything—or to care that the residents' strange behavior, as well as a shower of seashell hail, might be evidence of something extraterrestrial.</p> <p>Being both non-binary and autistic, he's convinced his reputation as the town eccentric is impeding his quest for answers. Frustrated, he documents the bizarre incidents on his failing pie blog, and his online popularity skyrockets. His readers want the truth, spurring him to get to the bottom of things.</p> <p>The only person in town who takes him seriously is handsome bartender Ezra. As the two investigate over pie and the possibility of romance, the alien presence does more than change the weather; people start disappearing. When Denver and Ezra make a run for it, the town refuses to let them leave. Reality is folding in on itself. It's suddenly a race against time to find the extraterrestrial source and destroy it before it consumes not only Muddy Gap but everything beyond.</p> <p>Denver's always been more outsider than hero, but he's determined to ensure that a world with Ezra—and pie—still exists tomorrow.</p>";
