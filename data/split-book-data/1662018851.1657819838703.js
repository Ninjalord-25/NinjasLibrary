window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If there's one thing Beatrice Tanaka never wanted to be, it's normal. But somehow, her life has unfolded as a series of should-haves. Her powers of emotional projection should have made her one of the most formidable superheroes of all time. And she should have been allowed to join her older sister Evie as a full-fledged protector of San Francisco, pulverizing the city's plethora of demon threats.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Evie and her superheroing partner, Aveda Jupiter, insist on seeing Bea as the impulsive, tempestuous teenager she used to be - even though she's now a responsible adult. And that means Bea is currently living a thoroughly normal life. She works as a bookstore lackey, hangs out with best friends Sam Fujikawa and Leah Kim, and calms her workplace's more difficult customers. Sure, she's not technically supposed to be playing with people's mental states, but given the mundanity of her existence, who can blame her?&nbsp;</p> <p>When a mysterious being starts communicating with Bea, hinting at an evil that's about to overtake the city, she seizes the opportunity, hoping to turn her should-haves into the fabulous heroic life she's always wanted. But gaining that life may mean sacrificing everything - and everyone - she holds dear....</p>";
