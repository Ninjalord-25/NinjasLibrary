And when their youngest daughter comes of age, magic flows anew. The lineage continues, though new generations struggle not only to master their power, but also to keep it hidden.</p> <p>But when World War II looms on the horizon, magic is needed more urgently than ever—not for simple potions or visions, but to change the entire course of history.</p>";
