window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A photographer, Abner Cray, goes to NYC to work on a coffee table photo book about Manhattan. In the apartment he's renting, he encounters and falls in love with a woman, Phyllis Pellaprat. Halfway through the story, the listener will find out that she's dead. Worse still, the absent friend whose apartment he's using was the one who murdered her. Beyond that, he's been given the doubtful gift of seeing and interacting with hundreds of spirits that inhabit Manhattan.</p> <p><b>About the author: </b>Terrance Michael Wright (aka T.M. Wright) is best known as the author of horror fiction, speculative fiction, and poetry. He has written over 25 novels, novellas, and short stories over the last 40 years.
