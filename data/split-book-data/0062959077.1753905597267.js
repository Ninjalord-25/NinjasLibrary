window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The award-winning and critically-acclaimed master of horror returns with a pair of chilling tales - both never-before-published in print or audio - that examine the violence and depravity of the human condition.</b></p> <p>Bringing together his acclaimed novella <i>The Sea Dreams It Is the Sky</i> and an all-new short novel <i>My Heart Struck Sorrow</i>, John Hornor Jacobs turns his fertile imagination to the evil that breeds within the human soul. </p> <p>A brilliant mix of the psychological and supernatural, blending the acute insight of Roberto Bola√±o and the eerie imagination of H. P. Lovecraft, <i>The Sea Dreams It Is the Sky</i> examines life in a South American dictatorship. Centered on the journal of a poet-in-exile and his failed attempts at translating a maddening text, it is told by a young woman trying to come to grips with a country that nearly devoured itself.</p> <p>In <i>My Heart Struck Sorrow</i>, a librarian discovers a recording from the Deep South - which may be the musical stylings of the Devil himself.</p> <p>Breathtaking and haunting, <i>A Lush and Seething Hell</i> is a terrifying and exhilarating journey into the darkness, an odyssey into the deepest reaches of ourselves that compels us to confront secrets best left hidden.</p>";
