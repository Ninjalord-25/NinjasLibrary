window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Hood’s new novel <i>Mountain Folk </i>uses elements of folklore and epic fantasy to tell the story of America’s founding in a fresh and exciting way.&nbsp;</p> <p>Goran is one of the rare fairies who can live without magical protection in the Blur, the human world where the days pass 20 times faster than in fairy realms. Goran’s secret missions for the Rangers Guild take him across the British colonies of North America - from far-flung mountains and rushing rivers to frontier farms and bustling towns. Along the way, Goran encounters Daniel Boone, George Washington, an improbably tall dwarf, a mysterious water maiden, and a series of terrifying monsters from European and Native American legend. But when Goran is ordered to help the other fairy nations of the New World crush the American Revolution, he must choose between a solemn duty to his own people and a fierce loyalty to his human friends and the principles they hold dear.</p>";
