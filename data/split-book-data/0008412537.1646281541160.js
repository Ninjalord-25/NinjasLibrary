No chance of failure.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Welcome to Learn with Paul Noble - a tried-and-tested language-learning method that has been used by over one million people to speak fluently and confidently. </i>&nbsp;</p> <p>With Paul Noble’s simple, relaxed approach, you will learn in a way that suits you - without having to memorise long lists of words you won’t use; scribbling notes as you listen; or feeling frustrated. Instead, Paul will introduce you to the basics of Japanese and guide you through over 15 hours of everyday scenarios - from simple situations like asking for directions and eating out to talking about yourself and how to master the different tenses - that are practical, fun and applicable. Just listen, interact and learn wherever you are.</p> <p>Whatever your experience with languages, whether you’re an absolute beginner or someone with basic knowledge who wants to improve their ability, this is the course to get you speaking Japanese quickly and confidently.&nbsp;</p> <p>A native Japanese expert will help you to perfect your pronunciation as you progress through the course. You will learn a huge range of vocabulary in no time at all, and be able to quickly make your new knowledge work for you in a variety of everyday scenarios. A downloadable booklet is also included to use as a reference and revision tool.</p> <p>Paul Noble left school unable to speak a language - having found that the traditional learning methods left him feeling ‘confused, incapable and unable to really say anything’. Determined that there must be a better way to learn, Paul spent years devising his own unique method of learning languages which cuts out all the grammar, all the memorisation and all the stress. He began using his method to teach in his Language Institute and, thousands of students later, he prides himself on never having had a student fail.</p> <p>This download contains the entire course - Parts 1, 2 and 3. To continue your language-learning journey once you’ve completed this course, download <i>Next Steps in Japanese with Paul Noble for Intermediate Learners - Complete Course</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
