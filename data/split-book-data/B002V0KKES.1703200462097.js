window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Peretti’s&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling novel where things that go bump in the night are only a heartbeat away.</p> <p>Miles away from the hectic city, Reed and Rebecca hike into the beautiful Northwester woods. They are surrounded by gorgeous mountains, waterfalls, and hundreds of acres of unspoiled wilderness.&nbsp;</p> <p>During their first night of camping, an unearthly wail pierces the calm of the forest. Then someone - no, something - emerges from the dense woods and begins pursuing them. Everything that follows is a blur to Reed - except for the unforgettable image of a huge creature carrying his wife into the darkness.</p> <p>Enter into deep wilderness where the rules of civilization no longer apply. A world where strange shadows lurk. Where creatures long attributed to overactive imaginations and nightmares are the hunters...and people are the hunted.</p> <p>“Colleen Coble always raises the notch on romantic suspense, and&nbsp;One Little Lie&nbsp;is my favorite yet! The story took me on a wild and wonderful ride.”&nbsp;(Diann Mills, best-selling author)</p> <p>Full length, standalone novel</p> <p>Includes discussion questions for book clubs</p>";
