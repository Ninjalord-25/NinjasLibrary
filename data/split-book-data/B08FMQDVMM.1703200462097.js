window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first book in the wildly popular series of horror/comedy novels featuring Andrew Mayhem!</b></p> <p>When you’re desperate for money, searching for a little adventure, and aren’t the most responsible person in the world, you can end up doing some outrageous things. Which is how Andrew Mayhem, a married father of two, ends up accepting $20,000 to find a key - a key buried with a body in a shallow grave.</p> <p>But what he finds in the grave isn’t quite what he expected, and what begins as a simple evening of morally questionable manual labor turns into a really good way to die. Andrew finds himself investigating a murder while forced into a bizarre game of wits and courage played by an unseen killer with a twisted sense of humor. It’s a game that will involve him with a group of filmmakers known as Ghoulish Delights, who are hiding a secret that will test every last bit of Andrew’s nerve to discover.</p> <p>And it’s impossible to find a babysitter.</p> <p>\"No author working today comes close to Jeff Strand's perfect mixture of comedy and terror.\" (<i>Cemetery Dance</i>)</p>";
