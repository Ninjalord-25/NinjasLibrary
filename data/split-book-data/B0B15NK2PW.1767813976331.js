With the help of an ancient and unknowable force, Jerry finds a way to interact with the magic of the new world as if it were a game. Using this new power, he sets out to save as many fellow abductees as possible before they are murdered by this new world’s vicious inhabitants. </p> <p>I don’t know how long I’ve been sitting at this particular desk. However, what I do know is that my boredom is about to come to an end. The tides of chaos have changed, rifts have opened to other worlds, and unless I miss my guess, nothing will ever be the same. Within the day, a new lord will come to power, and in his path, nations will burn. </p>";
