window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rory Thorne is a princess with 13 fairy blessings, the most important of which is to see through flattery and platitudes. As the eldest daughter, she always imagined she'd inherit her father's throne and govern the interplanetary Thorne Consortium.</p> <p>Then, her father is assassinated, her mother gives birth to a son, and Rory is betrothed to the prince of a distant world.</p> <p>When Rory arrives in her new home, she uncovers a treacherous plot to unseat her newly betrothed and usurp his throne. An unscrupulous minister has conspired to name himself Regent to the minor (and somewhat foolish) prince. With only her wits and a small team of allies, Rory must outmaneuver the Regent and rescue the prince.</p> <p><i>How Rory Thorne Destroyed the Multiverse</i> is a feminist reimagining of familiar fairy tale tropes and a story of resistance and self-determination - how small acts of rebellion can lead a princess to not just save herself, but change the course of history.</p>";
