window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Suit up. Lights down. Cardinal is in town, and it’s time to party.</p> <p>There’s only one place in town everyone wants to be. Club Cardinal is a pop-up nightclub, casino, and strip bar. It serves one purpose: to please. No matter how forbidden your desires, or carnal your needs, the staff of Cardinal will provide. For a price. </p> <p>Denna is down on her luck. She’s just walked out on the latest back-alley strip joint she called work; her brother is an alcoholic and homeless. Neither of them want to admit to their parents just how badly their lives are going. And Denna just found a decapitated corpse. But it’s okay; she’s just scored a lucrative job at the hottest joint in town. </p> <p>Frau Mann, Cardinal’s elusive owner, didn’t have a normal childhood. Mentally and physically manipulated by her father in the twisted halls of one of Germany’s most notorious detention camps, she grew up believing that the world would be hers. And piece by piece, finger by finger, Angela Mann has built a business empire envied the world over. </p> <p>Cardinal didn’t get its reputation by being an average haunt. You can have beautiful men and beautiful women. You can have drugs; you can gamble. You can have blood. You can take blood, and flay flesh. </p> <p>Cardinal is open in town and hunting for a new crop. It’s time to reap the harvest.</p>";
