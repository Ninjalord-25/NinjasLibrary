window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I was scraping by in LA: dinner was regularly Taco Bell salsa packets, my love life consisted of freeze-framing Scarlett Johansson action scenes, and my only hobby was drawing until my fingers bled. All that changed when I got my big break, an interview with Magnum Comics, the largest entertainment company in the world! But what I found there was a lot more than a job... I found the power to bring anything I draw into reality!</p> <p>If you enjoy fantasy comedies like <i>The Mask</i> with Jim Carrey, if you enjoy genre-bending action like <i>Ready Player One</i>, you'll get a kick out of this adult fantasy adventure romp!</p>";
