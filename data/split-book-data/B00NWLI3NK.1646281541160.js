window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Magical Crimes</i> is a fun CSI with magic and \"a little something else\" story. The little something else being two-foot-long and lurking in the hero’s trousers. But don’t worry, the penis in this story is used purely for the purpose God intended - humour and crimefighting - not lustful titillation. </p><p>Seb Kemp is a psychic profiler with a problem. After a night out drinking some men wake up with an unexpected tattoo. Seb woke up with a floor-length boinkwurst and no memory of how, when, or where it happened. To make matters worse, magic doesn’t work well with living tissue. The results are unpredictable. The spell might fade after a few days or...something might drop off. He needs help but, Pete, his forensic magician partner, is 3,000 miles away working on another case and Tulsa, Seb’s new partner, is of the young and female persuasion. Not to mention extremely hot. The two of them are thrown together to solve a high-profile locked-room mystery where the utmost tact and diplomacy is required - not easy for a man with unpredictable trousers. <i>Magical Crimes</i> is just over 13,000 words in length which equates to about 65 pages of a mass-market paperback.</p>";
