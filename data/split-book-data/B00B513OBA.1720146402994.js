A city that the Ministry rules from the sunlit summit, and where the forsaken lurk in the darkness of Under. </p> <p>Rojan Dizon doesn't mind staying in the shadows, because he's got things to hide. Things like being a pain-mage, with the forbidden power to draw magic from pain. But he can't hide forever. </p> <p>Because when Rojan stumbles upon the secrets lurking in the depths of the Pit, the fate of Mahala will depend on him using his magic. And unlucky for Rojan - this is going to hurt. </p> <p>Book 1 of the Rojan Dizon series.</p>";
