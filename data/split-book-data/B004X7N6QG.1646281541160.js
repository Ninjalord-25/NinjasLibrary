But after spending eight treacherous months digging $175,000 in gold out of Desperation Peak - all he has left is desperation. Two sadistic strangers have taken his gold, and now they want to take his life. He's on the run - the target of a <i>Devil’s Manhunt.</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a time and a place where the only law is the law of survival, Beckdolt will have to live by his wits...or die by the bullet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also includes two additional Western tales: “Johnny, the Town Tamer”, the story of a local swindler who meets his match; and “Stranger in Town”, in which a drifter confronts a corrupt sheriff...and his own dark past.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fists are flying and the guns are blazing as the audio version of <i>Devil’s Manhunt puts you hot on the trail of blistering Wild West action.</i></p> <p><i>“A thrilling novel of greed, violence, survival and perseverance, Devil's Manhunt perfectly embodies the unbridled excitement of pulp fiction.\" (Midwest Book Review)</i>&nbsp;</p>";
