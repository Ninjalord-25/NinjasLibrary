In her dreams... </p> <p>One hundred years ago, a love story ended in tragedy, its mysteries left unsolved. It's time for the lake to give up its secrets. As each mystery unravels, it pulls Kate deeper into the eddy of a haunting folktale that has been handed down in whispers over generations. Now, it's Kate's turn to listen. </p> <p>As the drowned woman reaches out from the grave, Kate reaches back.
