Turns out, it's a lot of work!</p> <p>To reach his potential, he'll have to come to grips with the secrets of this mysterious world and the way its magic system functions. Can he find peace in the borderlands? Can he turn his Mastery of the Threads of Power into a fulfilling career as a masseur to the denizens of this fantasy world?
