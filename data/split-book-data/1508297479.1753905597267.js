After all, how bad could it be?</p> <p>Answer: pretty bad. Grandma was a hoarder, and her house is stuffed with useless rubbish. That would be horrific enough, but there’s more - Mouse stumbles across her step-grandfather’s journal, which at first seems to be filled with nonsensical rants...until Mouse encounters some of the terrifying things he described for herself.</p> <p>Alone in the woods with her dog, Mouse finds herself face-to-face with a series of impossible terrors - because sometimes, the things that go bump in the night are real, and they’re looking for you. And if she doesn’t face them head-on, she might not survive to tell the tale.</p> <p>From Hugo Award-winning author Ursula Vernon, writing as T. Kingfisher, <i>The Twisted Ones </i>is a gripping, terrifying tale bound to keep you up all night - from both fear and anticipation of what happens next.</p>";
