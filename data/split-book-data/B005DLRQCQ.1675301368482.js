window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A spectacular thriller inspired by John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> in which the final chapter of the War in Heaven is about to play out on Earth, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance. </p> <p>The Myth: When God cast the archangel Satan into Hell, ending the War in Heaven, peace prevailed on Earth - until the fallen angels took revenge in the Garden of Eden. Ever since, mankind has been in a struggle between good and evil, paradise and apocalypse: the fall of Rome, The Crusades, World Wars, nuclear proliferation, the Middle East Crisis.... The War in Heaven never really ended - it just changed venues. For millennia, God's angels have been fighting Satan's demons on Earth, all in hopes of bringing about Satan's greatest ambition, the Apocalypse. </p> <p>The Reality: Satan has never been closer to his goal than right now. Agent Bernadette Callahan is a talented investigator at a shadowy government organization known only as Section, on the trail of a serial killer with nearly supernatural abilities. Sebastian \"Batty\" LaLaurie is a religious historian who knows far too much about the other side - and that hard-earned knowledge is exactly what Callahan needs. This unlikely duo pair up for a race across the globe, decoding clues left in ancient texts from the Bible to <i>Paradise Lost</i> and beyond. In the process they stumble upon a vast conspiracy - one beyond the scope of mankind's darkest imagination.</p>";
