window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Finna is about to be taken on a journey that will change her life forever. Little does she know that when her mother appears on her doorstep it will begin a chain of events that will eventually impact even the baby she carries. How can she believe the wild stories her mother tells her: A parallel world right next to this one? Gods and goddess, druids? But for some reason she finds herself following the amazingly convincing Catriona, who has an uncanny way of eliminating her fears. It is only later when they are deep into the wilderness of Otherworld that she realizes the truth. She has put herself and her unborn child in mortal danger. There are dark forces after her, creatures and beings Catriona failed to mention, and there is no way back.</p>";
