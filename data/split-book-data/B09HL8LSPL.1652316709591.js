window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eleven-year-old Tracy Fenton wakes to screams in the night. Bad dreams she's had since the tragic death of her mother in a mysterious house fire four years earlier, but no real memory of what really happened. Over the past few years, Tracy has bounced from one foster home to the next until finally ending up at Windermere Mental Health, a facility for troubled children. The only good thing about Windermere is that she has made a friend, Mary, a special girl who has Downs Syndrome.</p> <p>With the help of psychologist Bonnie Finch, who was kidnapped as a child by a woman she believes was a witch, the memories of that horrible night are coming back. And it is the discovery of her own strange gifts that leads Tracy to the realization that she must make a terrible choice, one that will decide the course of her life.</p>";
