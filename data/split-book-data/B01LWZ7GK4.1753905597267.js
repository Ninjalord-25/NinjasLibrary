These stories (which are also common to the North of Ireland), are wild and fantastic, with every flavour of Scotland throughout. They tell of heroes and heroines who set out on dangerous quests, giants and monsters, fairy folk and other mythical creatures, strange other-lands and mysterious meetings. They have a peculiar Celtic fascination of their own, and they are quite distinct from the more traditional (Grimm-style) fairy tales. These tales, in Scotland, have also a character of their own, for there is no country where the existence of spirits and goblins has been so implicitly believed in up to a comparatively recent date. </p><p>From morality tales to spooky stories, these 28 fascinating fictions are performed with energy and amazing characterisation by Steven Cree, one of the UK's most versatile actors, currently making a big splash in the US hit TV series Outlander. </p><p>Collected and edited by Elizabeth W Grierson and originally published in 1910, the audio collection contains the following tales: 'Thomas the Rhymer', 'Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree', 'Whippety-Stourie', 'The Red Etin', 'The Seal-Catcher and the Merman', 'The Pageboy and the Silver Goblet', 'The Black Bull of Norroway', 'The Wee Bannock', 'The Elfin Knight', 'Nippit-Fit and Clippit-Fit', 'The Fairies of Merlin's Crag', 'Habetrot', 'The Spinstress', 'The Wedding of Robin Redbreast and Jenny Wren', 'The Dwarfie Stone', 'Canonbie Dick and Thomas of Ercildoune', 'The Laird o' Co', 'Poussie Baudrons', 'The Milk-White Doo', 'The Draiglin' Hogney', 'The Brownie o' Ferne-Den', 'The Witch of Fife', 'Assipattle and the Mester Stoorworm', 'The Fox and the Wolf', 'Katherine Crackernuts', 'The Well o' the World's End', 'Farquhar MacNeill', 'Peerifool', 'The Heather Lintie'. </p><p>Read by Steven Cree (<i>Outlander</i>, <i>Brave</i>, <i>John Carter</i>, <i>300 Rise of an Empire</i>, <i>Maleficent</i>. </p>";
