window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p> <p>The first volume in a stunning trilogy set in the world of Arthurian legend and told from the perspective of its traditional antagonist, Morgan Le Fay.</p> <p>Even as a girl Morgan has always been wild, like the seas which batter the cliffs beneath her home, Tintagel Castle. But she has always been safe, too.</p> <p>Then one day her father is called away to a war from which he does not return. In his place comes the High King, Uther Pendragon, with the sorcerer Merlin lurking in his wake. Uther claims Morgan’s mother, the Lady Igraine as his queen.</p> <p>Now, in a world of knights and chivalry where she is all but voiceless, Morgan is faced with a choice: to follow her own fierce intelligence or to submit to the limitations powerful men would place upon her. She cannot, she will not choose submission.</p> <p>So begins this richly told debut from Sophie Keetch, which traces Morgan’s journey to adulthood. She will fall in love with a man saved from the sea. She will defy kings and suffer the consequences. At times she will almost despair. But ultimately she will discover a power in herself that even Merlin is awed by–a power that will give her control of her own destiny and which see her join Arthur at Camelot.</p> <p>And even this is only a beginning…</p>";
