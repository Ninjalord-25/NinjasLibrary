When a closed cold case is dug up, she finds herself becoming consumed to set things right. No amount of '80s music or repeated viewings of her favorite movie <i>Dirty Dancing </i>were enough to distract her. She needed a vacation in the worst of ways.</p> <p>When she set foot in the gorgeous tropical resort in Greece, she had no idea she'd meet a man claiming to be Hades, god of the Underworld. And she certainly had no idea that he was telling the truth. Her Greek vacation was about to become very...interactive.</p> <p>A Hades/Persephone reimagining.</p> <p>The Contemporary Mythos series will feature a different Greek god in each book, reexploring their myths and combining contemporary romance tropes. Though they will all stand alone, the stories will also intersect for those that listen to them all.</p>";
