window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Legacy Academy!</p> <p>There are three rules at this supernatural academy: Date your own kind. Mixing with other races is forbidden. Never speak or look at The Royals, the powerful princes destined to rule each of their kingdoms. Avoid the human world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, I’ve already broken all the rules.&nbsp;</p> <p>There’s something different about me. Something that’s not pure. I’m not like the other dragon shifters. Maybe it’s because of my human blood.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Royals have noticed me, and every girl at the Academy hates me.&nbsp;</p> <p>I never knew the paranormal world existed until one day I have a fight with Mom, I come home to find her gone, and poof, I’m a dragon shifter.&nbsp;</p> <p>It would have been nice if Mom would have told me. But then again, secrets rule my family....</p> <p>But now she’s been kidnapped and I have no answers. I have to find her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some powerful demon is after me, because supposedly I’m a threat to his power. Which is crazy! Has he seen me in class?&nbsp;</p> <p>Grab this new romance academy and enroll in Legacy where you’ll meet dragons, wolves, demons, Fae, and vampires!</p>";
