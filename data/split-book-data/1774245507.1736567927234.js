As a Chosen One, it is his duty to save his world from the cruel caress of the Void. Part of that duty is to fight alongside his fellow Chosen Ones, but can Jelly really handle the other two individuals the goddess Nia has selected to save Erafore?</p> <p>He will need every ounce of cunning and strength he can scrounge up, though, because the forces of the Void will not tolerate this gathering of Chosen Ones, and will slay them if at all possible. His companions are Dora, a half-orc Healer who carries guilt and resentment about her life back home, and Gaelin, a nice guy wearing cursed armor, and who has a worrying hatred for birds.</p> <p>Can the three of them survive each other?</p>";
