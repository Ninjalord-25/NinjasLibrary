They often take as much pleasure in tearing down the idols that they have grown tired of as they did in elevating them in the first place. It is safer by far to live unseen and unremarked, as I always attempt to do. </i></p> <p>An ancient kingdom. An incredible destiny. </p> <p>Taita is a humble slave, an expert in art, poetry, medicine and engineering as well as keeping important secrets. He is the most treasured possession of Lord Intef. Yet when Intef's beautiful daughter, Lostris, is married to the Pharaoh, Taita is commanded to follow her and swiftly finds himself deeper than he ever could have imagined in a world of deception and treachery. </p> <p>But outside the palace, the great kingdom of Egypt is divided and in even greater danger. Enemies threaten on all sides, and only Taita holds the power to save them all....</p> <p>The first audiobook in the epic Egyptian Series.</p>";
