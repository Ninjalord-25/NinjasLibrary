He doesn’t know her name or the sound of her voice, but he knows the sound of her heart, and it’s broken.

She’s not looking for adventure, love, or even friends. She only wants a peaceful life for herself and a fresh start.</p> <p>Falling into the waiting arms of Connor O’Brian changes everything, and Darcie soon realizes fate has other plans in store for her.
