window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Kill. Kill them all.\" It's the first four words Lars usually wakes up to every morning as the voice in his head nags him, telling him she's just giving him a \"quest\" that will help him \"level\". </b></p> <p>But even if he wanted to do it, he can't. They're cultivators; beings with ancestral bloodlines that have powers he could only dream of and that may as well be gods while he is stuck as a puny human. Even if he could kill them, the people who bullied him, beat him, treated him like a punch-bag pariah for being the \"tailless worthless human\" that he was to them, he wouldn't. It just wasn't in Lars's nature.&nbsp;</p> <p>That is, until a vicious group of murderous psychopaths called a \"sect\" descend on his village. The vicious group brutally kills everyone he's known his entire life, taking a select few with them as slaves. Lars must now trust he isn't going insane and find a way to complete the voice's quests and level up, so that he can save his mother from her cruel and heartless captors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Death's Favorite Warlock<i> is a cultivation themed LitRPG adventure series. </i></p>";
