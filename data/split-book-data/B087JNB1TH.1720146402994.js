window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A homecoming tale unlike any other, <i>The Imagined Homecoming of Icarus Isakov</i> recounts the fantastical return home of the goblin anti-hero and puckish narrator Icarus Isakov.</p> <p>When Icarus receives a mysterious letter from the long-lost girl next door, he returns to the ghost town of his childhood in search of her. Icarus lodges at a mystical tavern, one serving memories instead of drinks.&nbsp;</p> <p>There, imbibing the past and exploring the present, Icarus is swept up on a wonderfully strange adventure, taking him from the depths of wish-filled seas to the highest of dream castle ramparts.</p> <p>Along the way, Icarus faces old demons with help from a curious cast of characters, including a forgetful faun, a drunken elf, and a chance mermaid. It will take all of them to find the girl next door and to rediscovery home.</p> <p><i>The Homecoming of Icarus Isakov</i> is a touching and thought-provoking ride through nostalgia, memory, and the fantasy of youth. Icarus’s playful narration style make the story fly, and the magical tavern makes a stunning backdrop for this surreal odyssey.</p>";
