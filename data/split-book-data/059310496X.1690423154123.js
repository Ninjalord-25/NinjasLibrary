She knows it's kinda lame, but what else is she supposed to do? Get a job? Gross. Besides, Esme likes babysitting, and she's good at it.</p> <p>And lately, Esme needs all the cash she can get, because it seems like destruction follows her wherever she goes. Let's just say she owes some people a new tree.</p> <p>Enter Cassandra Heaven. She's Instagram-model hot, dresses like she found her clothes in a dumpster, and has a rebellious streak as gnarly as the cafeteria cooking. So why is Cassandra willing to do anything, even take on a potty-training two-year-old, to join Esme's babysitters club?</p> <p>The answer lies in a mysterious note Cassandra's mother left her: \"Find the babysitters. Love, Mom.\"</p> <p>Turns out, Esme and Cassandra have more in common than they think, and they're about to discover what being a babysitter really means: a heroic lineage of superpowers, magic rituals, and saving the innocent from seriously terrifying evil. And all before the parents get home.</p> <p>\"<i>The Baby-Sitters Club</i>...but spooky.\" (<i>Cosmopolitan</i>)</p> <p>\"A high-energy series starter that's plenty of fun.\" (<i>Booklist</i>)</p> <p>\"Combines everything you love.\" (<i>Man Repeller</i>)</p>";
