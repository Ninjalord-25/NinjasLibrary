window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Decadence and murder found on the dark side of the big city pales in comparison to the freak show found by undercover US narcotics agent Bob Clark in <i>The Carnival of Death.</i></p> <p>Clark’s investigation begins with cocaine and leads to cold-blooded murder - the discovery of one, and then another, headless corpse. Who is behind the slaughter? Are the killings tied to the drug traffic? Or is a deeper, darker, and even more sinister conspiracy unfolding in the carnival?</p> <p>There are plenty of distractions - bright lights and beautiful girls - but Clark better find the murderers of the midway fast. Because the next head that rolls could very well be his own. <br> Also includes the mystery “The Death Flyer”, in which a man and woman find themselves trapped on a ghost train and bound for a deadly crash...unless they can find a way to derail fate and cheat death - on the fly.</p> <p>Experience the spinning wheels, the pleasure-seeking crowds and the screams of horror as the audio version of <i>The Carnival of Death</i> takes you on a roller-coaster ride of suspense.</p> <p>“Highly recommended.” (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br> “Roars to life.” (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p>";
