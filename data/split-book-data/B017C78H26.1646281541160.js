window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Dan Wells, author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Partials Sequence, comes the first book in a new sci-fi noir series. </p> <p>Los Angeles in 2050 is a city of open doors, as long as you have the right connections. That connection is a djinni - a smart device implanted right in a person's head. In a world where virtually everyone is online 24 hours a day, this connection is like oxygen - and a world like that presents plenty of opportunities for someone who knows how to manipulate it. </p> <p>Marisa Carneseca is one of those people. She might spend her days in Mirador, but she lives on the net - going to school, playing games, hanging out, or doing things of more questionable legality with her friends, Sahara and Anja. And it's Anja who first gets her hands on Bluescreen - a virtual drug that plugs right into a person's djinni and delivers a massive, nonchemical, completely safe high. But in this city, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is, and Mari and her friends soon find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy that is much bigger than they ever suspected. </p>";
