This year, with a bad economy and Shay out of work, it’s more important than ever to bag a deer so they can feed their families. Tucking their truck in their secret spot outside a state park in the Catskills, they settle down, waiting for a deer to come to them. </p> <p>Discovery </p> <p>What they get is a giant creature that outruns a speeding deer and savages it with its bare hands and jagged teeth. Someone hidden in the woods shoots it with a tranquilizer dart. Shay knows what the beast at their feet is, and how its discovery can change their lives forever. They load it into their truck and head home for....</p> <p>The Bronx </p> <p>The drugged Bigfoot awakens in a cramped shed in Shay’s backyard. Confused, terrified, angry, it breaks loose in the middle of the night, seeking refuge in a nearby cemetery. When the bagpipes of a morning funeral drive it into a killing rage, the carnage has just begun. </p> <p>Rampage </p> <p>From playgrounds to golf courses, apartment buildings to subway cars, the bigfoot is on the move - and it’s not happy. Can Shay and Vito find and recapture the beast before it burns the Bronx to the ground?</p>";
