window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Leigh Bardugo's </b><b><i>Six of Crows</i></b><b> meets Kristin Cashore's </b><b><i>Graceling, </i></b><b>with a dash of Winter Is Coming, in this showstopping debut YA fantasy! </b></p> <p>“A can’t miss debut from an exciting new talent.” (Kiersten White, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Slayer</i>)</p> <p><i>The Age of Darkness approaches.</i> <i>Five lives stand in its way.</i> <i>Who will stop it . . . or unleash it? </i></p> <p>For generations, the Seven Prophets guided humanity. Using their visions of the future, they ended wars and united nations - until the day, 100 years ago, when the Prophets disappeared.&nbsp;</p> <p>All they left behind was one final, secret prophecy, foretelling an Age of Darkness and the birth of a new Prophet who could be the world’s salvation . . . or the cause of its destruction. With chaos on the horizon, five souls are set on a collision course:&nbsp;</p> <p>A prince exiled from his kingdom. <br> A ruthless killer known as the Pale Hand. <br> A once-faithful leader torn between his duty and his heart. <br> A reckless gambler with the power to find anything or anyone. <br> And a dying girl on the verge of giving up.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of them - or all of them - could break the world. Will they be savior or destroyer?&nbsp;</p> <p>Perfect for fans of <i>Throne of Glass</i>, <i>Children of Blood and Bone</i>, and <i>An Ember in the Ashes</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>There Will Come a Darkness</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>“Even in a world filled with graces and prophets, the real magic of <i>There Will Come a Darkness</i> is in how Pool has crafted her heroes - messy, flawed, and so beguilingly human. I dare you not to fall madly in love with all of them.” (Laura Sebastian, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Ash Princess</i>)</p> <p>\"A well-crafted, surprising, and gripping start to a new trilogy.\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review)</p>";
