window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All 18 episodes of the BBC radio sitcom about a 30-something barmaid living on a tiny Scottish island. </b></p> <p>Irene Bruce spends her days pulling pints in Millport, the only town on the Isle of Cumbrae, a few miles off the west coast of Scotland. Frustrated and going nowhere fast, she yearns to escape to the mainland for a better life - or at least a bit of fun. Just over the water, there are clubs, cinemas and discos, so why is she stuck at home with tea, Scrabble and her boring sister, Moira?</p> <p>In these three series, Irene tries her hand at matchmaking, celebrates her 33rd birthday, faces a dilemma over a talking dog and finds romance where she least expects it. And as Cumbrae is beset by strange events and emergencies - from a missing pensioner, to a threat to the local pub, to a media makeover that risks ruining the island's integrity - she keeps trying to leave town, and keeps being pulled back. But when push finally comes to shove, she's forced to consider where her heart really lies: on the mainland, or in Millport....&nbsp;</p> <p>Written by and starring Lynn Ferguson (<i>No Angels</i>, <i>Chicken Run</i>) as Irene, this bittersweet comedy drama boasts an all-Scottish cast and a panoply of vibrant, eccentric characters.
