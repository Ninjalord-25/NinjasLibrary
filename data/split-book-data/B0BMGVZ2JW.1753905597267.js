What's more, I have a unique suite of abilities that helps me further stand out from the crowd. So much, in fact, that I've started attracting the attention of multiple gorgeous women. These monster girl vampires include my teacher, my childhood friend, an old bully of mine, and Dracula's socially awkward daughter. That isn't counting the two gorgeous twins I've taken as thralls.</p> <p>If I'm doing this, I'm doing it right. I'm going to work hard, study harder, and play the hardest, making the best out of my new life. Nosferatu Academy, here I come.</p> <p><b><i>Content:</i></b><i> Nosferatu Academy contains themes that are common in dark fantasy, including intense scenes of violence, and light horror elements. But this is NOT a horror novel. It is a humorous fantasy story with an ambitious, dominant male lead. Just be warned: as a vampire novel, there is a bit of blood here and there.</i></p>";
