window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Wine of Angels</i></b><b> is the first instalment in the Merrily Watkins series from highly acclaimed author Phil Rickman.</b></p> <p>The new vicar had never wanted a picture-postcard parish - or a huge and haunted vicarage. Nor had she wanted to walk into a dispute over a controversial play about a 17th-century clergyman accused of witchcraft...a story that certain long-established families would rather remained obscure.</p> <p>But this is Ledwardine, steeped in cider and secrets...a paradise of cobbled streets and timber-framed houses. And also - as Merrily Watkins and her teenage daughter, Jane, discover - a village where horrific murder is a tradition that spans centuries.</p>";
