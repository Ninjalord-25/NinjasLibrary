He'll find peace where he can while being very much aware of how fragile his existence can be in a world filled with creatures and beings more powerful than he. He's happy enough to embrace the life of a fisherman bringing food in for his warren, and live in peace as long as he can.<br> <br> Fate, it would seem, had different plans. A group of raiders invades his home territory and kicks off a series of events that will change his life forever. He is a survivor: it is the driving motivation behind all kobolds. When his life is threatened, Yynnc reaches beyond what he ever thought he was capable of doing.<br> <br> On his world, the information and details of his entire life are at his fingertips. He will need to learn all he can about himself. Then, he will have to learn far more than what his local Shamans taught him about what is possible so he can carve a path for himself in the world. Yet, while the wider world might be interesting and filled with glorious promise and pleasures, the likes of which he has never known, there are far, far too many dangers waiting to grind a careless kobold into the dust.<br> <br> But those forces didn't count on the strength behind his convictions. He must survive. It's in his blood.<br> <br> === Caution from the Author ===<br> This audiobook contains content that might be seen as sensitive to some!
