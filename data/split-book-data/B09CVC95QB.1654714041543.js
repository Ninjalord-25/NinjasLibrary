window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Never promise a fey anything.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>With magic leaking back into our world, working the nightshift as a paramedic comes with danger.&nbsp;But I handle it. I’ve got a shotgun for the zombies, and my lycanthropic rage hasn’t escaped my apartment. Life is normal-ish. All that changes when I’m called to help a dying fey knight and I make a promise.</p> <p>There’s a little girl with big eyes and a heart-rending sniffle. I can’t say no. Of course she’s not human. She’s their key to opening the long-closed gates and feasting on humanity.</p> <p>Now, an entire world I know nothing about is trying to kill me. And if I don’t protect her, the teeth around my heart will finish the job. If I learn fast and bargain the right parts of my soul, the girl and I might make it out alive. Otherwise the cruelest winter will freeze even the warmest hearts in the&nbsp;city.</p> <p>Listen to my story now and ride along for a wild emergency shift.</p> <p>Includes bonus story <i>Twilight Run</i>.</p>";
