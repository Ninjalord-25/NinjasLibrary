window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Maria V. Snyder begins an action-packed new fantasy series: Archives of the Invisible Sword.</b></p> <p><b>2020 PRISM Award winner: fantasy</b></p> <p><b>He thinks you are the thief....</b></p> <p>Shyla is a researcher who resides in the underground desert city of Zirdai, which is ruled by the wealthy Water Prince and brutal Heliacal Priestess. Even though Shyla is sun-kissed - an outcast, considered cursed by the Sun Goddess - she is still renowned for uncovering innumerable archaic facts, lost artefacts, ancient maps, and obscure historical documents.&nbsp;</p> <p>Her quiet life is about to change when Banqui, an archaeologist, enlists her services to find The Eyes of Tamburah: legendary gemstones that bestow great magic on their wielder. These ancient objects can tip the balance of power and give whoever possesses them complete control of the city.&nbsp;</p> <p>But chaos erupts when The Eyes are stolen soon after they're found - and Shyla is blamed for the theft. Forced to flee, with the prince's soldiers and the priestess' deacons on her trail, Shyla must recover the jewels and clear her name. A quest that will unearth secrets even more valuable than The Eyes of Tamburah themselves.</p>";
