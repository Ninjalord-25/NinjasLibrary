But the thief's companions are waiting, and the soldiers Rem and Torval travel with might not be so honorable.</p> <p>For more from Dale Lucas, check out:<br> &nbsp;</p> <p>The Fifth Ward:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li><i>First Watch</i></li> <li><i>Friendly Fire</i></li> <li><i>Good Company</i>&nbsp;</li> </ol>";
