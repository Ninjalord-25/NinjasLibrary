window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sir George Pyke is quite disappointed in his son Roderick's business acumen. Roderick, unlike his old man, lacks the aggressive drive required of a business tycoon. So the elder Pyke resolves to marry him off to the sprightly Felicia, who has enough spark to manage any man and may just do him a world of good. All is going well until Bill West arrives from New York. Felicia recognizes in this strong, ambitious chap the man for whom she should forsake all others - but making their way to the altar may be easier said than done. </p> <p>This romantic comedy from master humorist P. G. Wodehouse is sure to delight, whether you're new to his work or a longtime fan.</p>";
