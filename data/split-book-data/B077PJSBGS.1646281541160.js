window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Everlasting, Maine, where there's no such thing as normal.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meteorologist Zoe Parker put Everlasting in her rearview mirror as soon as she had her college degree in hand. But when Sapphire, her eccentric great-aunt, takes a tumble down the stairs in her lighthouse home, Zoe returns to the tiny fishing hamlet to look after her. Zoe has barely crossed the county line when strange things start happening with the weather, and she discovers Sapphire's fall was no accident. Someone is searching the lighthouse, but Sapphire has no idea what they're looking for. Determined to ensure her aunt's ongoing safety, Zoe promises to expose the intruders, even though it means staying in Everlasting and confronting the past she thought she's put behind her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dane Stanton never expected to see Zoe standing in the middle of her aunt's living room and is even more unprepared for the flood of emotion he experiences when coming face to face with his old flame. Zoe is just as independent and determined as he remembers, and Dane knows she won't rest until Sapphire can return to the lighthouse in peace, so he offers to help her sort things out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Armed with old legends, Sapphire's ten cats, and a talking ghost, Zoe has to reconcile her feelings for Dane and embrace her destiny before it's too late.</p>";
