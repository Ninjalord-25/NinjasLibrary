The Seagull fight, the Pigeon trade and the Cockroach scavenge, but the Rabbit had one rule: <i>If you want to see tomorrow, you run.</i><br> <br> But they didn't run fast enough when a weapon fell from the sky and consumed their home, and now Amri is alone, in the company of a fallen god named Guy Vesten. A god who promises revenge against the three gods who turned against him, and who killed her tribe.<br> <br> But gods don't die easily. Guy will need followers, like any god, and warriors to aid him in his quest. And if Amri is to find a place in the world that is to come, she may as well be standing at his right hand, as his priestess....</p>";
