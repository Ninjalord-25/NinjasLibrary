window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Amiran Steppes. An untamed land of vicious beasts and mythical dangers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Few know this better than Shandra the Wild Wolf. Born frail and cursed, the young woman proved herself time and again, against all odds, through many battles and trials. Yet, even the wandering warrior could not anticipate the bloody homecoming that awaited her.&nbsp;</p> <p>A powerful outland force, led by the fearsome and pious General Arabella, has devastated Shandra's tribe and stolen a most sacred relic: a godshard. Now, together with her beautiful childhood friend and an eccentric gnome with a questionable past, Shandra must journey forth to recover the godshard and avenge her people.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dangerous wilds, ancient monster-infested ruins, and a tangled web of love, loss, and secrets stand between Shandra's party and their goal. Even if they survive long enough to catch Arabella, can these three stand against the might of the Sal'Vari Empire, the most powerful army on Alban?</p>";
