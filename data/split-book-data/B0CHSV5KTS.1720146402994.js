window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A young man yearning for adventure must confront the harsh reality of a world that might not be the real one to begin with in this LitRPG fantasy adventure.</b></p> <p>For Prince Hail Teoran, there's never been a greater hero than his own father, a true living legend who came through the gates with his fellow Travelers years ago to rescue the continent of Lagrea from the forces of darkness. Unfortunately, when the young prince actually meets his dad for the first time, he turns out to be, well, a total jerkweed.</p> <p>Naturally, Hail is crushed. That is, until he's visited by a seemingly all-powerful administrator who explains that Hail, his mother, and everyone in their world are part of a game the Travelers are constantly playing. But that doesn't mean Hail isn't special. In fact, as a product of the union between his Traveler father and NPC mother, he's an ever-evolving AI—or <i>native</i> player character—which means he has the ability make his own way, seeking adventure, facing danger, and occasionally screwing up in truly epic fashion.</p> <p>And the more Hail learns, the stronger he grows in levels, stats, and experience, all of which he'll sorely need when his game world faces a peril that did <i>not</i> come to play . . .</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with almost 400,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
