window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Drawn from the superhero genre, <i>Magon </i>introduces the listener to a collection of new Celtic characters, but with a modern take. It explores the consequences of mixing ancient DNA into the modern world. It is the crossroads of a genius mind and a scientific experiment gone wrong.</p> <p>The dreams and aspirations of a young genetics student, confronted with the terror of a bullying roommate, who forces his victim to consume the results of his experiment - with catastrophic results. It is a dark world of science, mythology, forgotten legends, weird beings and weirder circumstances. It is a journey into the future, the primal, the unknown. It is the archetypal call to arms of beings with powers greater than ours.&nbsp;</p> <p>The clock is ticking....</p>";
