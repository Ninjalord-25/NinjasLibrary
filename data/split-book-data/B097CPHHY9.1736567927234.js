Together, they brought the whole continent to its knees.... Until the day she abandoned her army, on the eve of total victory.</p> <p>Forty years later, she must bring her former captains back together for one final stand, in the small town of Tarnbrooke - the last bastion against a fanatical new enemy tearing through the land, intent on finishing the job Black Herran started years before.</p> <p>Seven bloodthirsty monsters.
