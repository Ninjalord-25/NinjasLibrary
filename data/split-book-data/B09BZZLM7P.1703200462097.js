Maella comes from a family of doormakers - people who unleash otherworldly violence when they open something even as simple as a cabinet door. But when circumstances force Maella to open a portal, she discovers worlds of nightmarish flying monsters, mystical drug deals, political prisoners, religious cults, and a terrifying prediction: Maella will die upon opening her seventh door.&nbsp;</p> <p>In order to survive, Maella must uncover her family’s secrets, all while hiding her identity and outrunning the prediction of her death. But what do you do when the truth you need could destroy the universe?</p> <p>The Doormaker series from <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Jamie Thornton is for listeners who love portals, strange magic, conflicting prophecies, fortune-telling machines, dragon-like creatures, alternate planets, family curses, friendships, betrayal, and a budding romance that spans three worlds.</p>";
