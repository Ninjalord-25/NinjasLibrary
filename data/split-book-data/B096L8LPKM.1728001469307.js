window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Soul eating tattoo. Check. Self-replicating knife. Check. Two-hundred-year-old score to settle. Double check. Meet the immortal Doc Holliday.</p> <p>Lying on his deathbed, Dr. John Holliday was offered a choice; let the tuberculosis finish its work or accept immortality. Doc chose the latter, knowing full well that such “gifts” don’t come cheap, but damned if the last 200 years haven’t been a blast. Partying, playing, fighting, killing; yes, eternal life’s been good...But the time to get serious has finally come, and the task he’s always known he was saved for is at hand.</p> <p>Now in modern-day Denver, Doc will be pushed to his limits to keep his promise and save the missing descendent of the beautiful shaman who gave him everlasting life. The trouble is things aren’t going as planned, and it’s becoming clear that there is far more at stake than Doc bargained for...</p> <p>Fans of edgy Urban Fantasy look no further! If you’re into badass, morally ambiguous, anti-heroes that don’t flinch at killing bad guys (and stealing their souls) then this is the audiobook for you! It has the perfect blend of supernatural action, humor, and mystery that you crave.</p> <p>Listen to this first book in the new ongoing series today!</p> <p>(Do it now...Don’t fight it...Just let it happen.)</p> <p><b>Message from the Publisher:</b> Here at Lone Ghost Publishing we know full well just how much it sucks waiting for stuff, especially waiting for the next audiobook in a series you love; and that is why we are dedicated to a rapid release publishing schedule! That’s right, we’re putting out several great new Doc Holliday audiobooks each year, just for you! It isn’t easy on us (emotionally or physically) keeping M.M. Crumley chained to a desk and standing at the ready, whip-in-hand, to ensure this happens, but that is exactly what we’re doing. It’s a thankless job, we know, but we’re happy to do it for you (and ourselves) because we’re not only the people behind this great series, we’re also diehard fans!&nbsp; So thanks to our tireless efforts (and questionable business practices), you can commit to this awesome ongoing series confidently, knowing for certain that you won’t have to wait a full year to see what happens next.</p>";
