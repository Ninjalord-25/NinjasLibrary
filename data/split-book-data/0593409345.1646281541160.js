That storyline drives <i>Hell of a Book</i> and is the scaffolding of something much larger and more urgent: Mott’s novel also tells the story of Soot, a young Black boy living in a rural town in the recent past, and The Kid, a possibly imaginary child who appears to the author on his tour.</p> <p>As these characters’ stories build and converge, they astonish. For while this heartbreaking and magical book entertains and is at once about family, love of parents and children, art and money, it’s also about the nation’s reckoning with a tragic police shooting playing over and over again on the news. And with what it can mean to be Black in America.</p> <p>Who has been killed? Who is The Kid? Will the author finish his book tour, and what kind of world will he leave behind? &nbsp;Unforgettably told, with characters who burn into your mind and an electrifying plot ideal for book club discussion, <i>Hell of a Book</i> is the novel Mott has been writing in his head for the last ten years. And in its final twists, it truly becomes its title.</p>";
