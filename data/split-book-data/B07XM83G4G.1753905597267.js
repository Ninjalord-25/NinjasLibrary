If she can't harness her powers in time to figure out the truth behind his mysterious death, she may never have a moment of peace again.</p> <p><b>When death strikes the island’s controversial real estate mogul, will Tamsyn’s newly discovered powers be any match for murder?</b></p> <p>Don’t miss the new Witches of Pinecroft Cove series of paranormal cozy mysteries!</p>";
