Bubba and his whole team have been fired on account of going MIA for a year and a half (yeah, time moves differently in Fairyland - yay), and now they’ve got to…get jobs? Oh, this is going to go well.</p> <p><i>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears</i> tracks Bubba, Skeeter, Uncle Father Joe, and Amy as they reenter society, get new jobs, almost burn down down the bar stupid enough to hire Bubba, end up owning a shifter CrossFit gym, travel to Florida to learn way more about Uncle Father Joe’s new girlfriend than they ever thought they wanted to know, and then - end up dealing with Quincy F’n Harker?!?</p> <p>Yeah, that’s right. The Quincy Harker/Bubba crossover that you’ve all been waiting for happens right here, and the results are explosive, to say the least. No really, I’m not exaggerating. A lot of shit blows up. Because, well, Bubba.</p> <p><i>Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears </i>contains the following novellas:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Born to Be Wild</i></li> <li><i>Swamp Music</i></li> <li><i>Houses of the Holy</i></li> <li><i>Blaze of Glory</i></li> </ul>";
