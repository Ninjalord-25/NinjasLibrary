window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Author of </b><b><i>The Girl with All the Gifts </i></b><b>Mike Carey presents the first book in his hip supernatural thriller series featuring freelance exorcist Felix Castor.</b></p> <p>Felix Castor is a freelance exorcist, and London is his stomping ground. It may seem like a good ghostbuster can charge what he likes and enjoy a hell of a lifestyle, but there's a risk: sooner or later he's going to take on a spirit that's too strong for him.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Castor accepts a seemingly simple ghost-hunting case at a museum in the shadowy heart of London, what should have been a perfectly straightforward exorcism is rapidly turning into the Who Can Kill Castor First Show, with demons and ghosts all keen to claim the big prize.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that's business as usual: Castor knows how to deal with the dead. It's the living who piss him off....</p>";
