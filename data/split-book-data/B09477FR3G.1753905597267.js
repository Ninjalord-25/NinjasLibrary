window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>True Mate </i>is the first book in the Prosper Woods Chronicles, but don't miss <i>True Knight</i>, the incredible prequel to the series!</p> <p>When I moved to Prosper Woods, California, a couple of weeks ago, I’d had big plans for a quiet life. Let’s just say, things haven’t exactly turned out the way I expected they would. For one thing, as new sheriff, I hadn’t planned on investigating a murder the day after my arrival. For another thing, no one told me supernatural creatures existed. I didn’t believe it at first, but when Vincent Lasco suddenly smiled at me with a mouth full of fangs, things got interesting.</p> <p>Quiet small-town life indeed!</p> <p>The moment I decided to take Sheriff Romeo Harmon home for a roll in the sheets, I knew hiding my true nature was a huge mistake. Then again, things never turn out the way I expect. The simple life of anonymity I’d hoped to have in Prosper Woods has blown up in my face in the most poetic and spectacular way. Not only that, the guy isn’t even aware that he has secrets of his own. How a guy could have lived all his life not knowing what he was, seems nearly impossible but in his case, I know it’s true.</p> <p>Supernaturals are everywhere!</p> <p>The town of Prosper Woods has a couple of new residents who at first glance, seem very unsuited for small town life. Before long though, I realized they were right for the town...probably the only right thing about this weird place. Surprisingly, they fit right in.</p> <p>Things are about to get interesting!</p>";
