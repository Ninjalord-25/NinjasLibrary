All of them are members of the self-styled 'Sisters of Steel', and Alska, their leader, is with them. He's feeling good about the situation, as they're all experienced warriors.</p> <p>However, this still leaves him with other problems:</p> <p>- A dozen women (who he just rescued from certain death and now has to take care of and protect) and the task of figuring out what to do with them until he can send them home</p> <p>- Dr. Ruxton, who is most certainly up to something other than what he claims to be, but who has actually done a lot of good in the world considering that he is a ruthless man</p> <p>- A profitable black market business that needs to be run in such a manner as to make sure that those profits end up in&nbsp;<i>his </i>pocket</p> <p><i>-</i> A dark elf house that needs to be put in its place and taught a lesson</p> <p>Oh, and it&nbsp;<i>just</i> might be true that two of those women he rescued<i>&nbsp;just </i>might be famous. At least it won't be boring.</p> <p><i>Be of Good Cheer </i>contains strong language, consenting couples having consenting sexual relations, polygamy, a young lion figuring out his pride, a sheep being fleeced, money being made, hucksters being hucked and succubi being...I think you get the picture. Oh, and remember! If you see a guy in a collar muttering something about two crazed twins as he stumbles along ever eastward, you might just want to head in the opposite direction.</p>";
