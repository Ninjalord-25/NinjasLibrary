She wonders if it’s possible to earn a degree while completely avoiding eye contact with anyone.</p> <p>All she wants is to learn a little and maybe get over her anxiety. Instead, she’s granted a superpower and categorized as villainous. So, Emily panics—and inadvertently conjures up a pint-size supervillain sidekick.</p> <p>Emily has no intention of doing anything—evil or otherwise—with her powers. And if she has to babysit an increasing number of “little sisters” in order to stay under the radar, so be it.</p> <p>But can Emily gain control of her life, or will she drown in a sea of supervillainy and cuddles?</p>";
