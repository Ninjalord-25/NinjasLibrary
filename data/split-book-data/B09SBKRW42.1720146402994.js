People are getting hit with citrus fruit, car parts are vanishing into thin air, and the villainous Professor Huzzah is shouting from hijacked TV screens in the middle of the night.&nbsp;</p> <p>The city could use a superhero. Or at least a dedicated and competent vigilante. But Sylviana doesn't have any such people.&nbsp;</p> <p>It has Joey Stuffleberg, a mild-mannered marketing writer who doesn't want to be a hero. More than anything else, he wants a nap. But as it becomes increasingly clear there will be no time for naps unless the shouting professor is expelled, Joey realizes he needs to try to be a hero.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eventually, he may need to do more than try.&nbsp;</p>";
