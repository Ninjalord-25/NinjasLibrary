window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The 11th installment in the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling A Twisted Tale series asks: What if Meg had to become a Greek god?&nbsp;</p> <p>After Hercules proves he's a true hero and regains his godship, all seems right in the world. That is, until Zeus tells Meg that she can't be with Hercules because she's, well, mortal. Luckily, Hera has a solution, offering Meg a chance to prove herself worthy of a spot on Mt. Olympus - as a god. All Meg has to do is complete a mysterious quest.&nbsp;</p> <p>The mission? Oh, just to rescue her ex's current wife from the Underworld. The ex-boyfriend she saved by selling her soul to Hades. The ex-boyfriend who immediately moved on to someone else while she was stuck in the Underworld. Can Meg put her past behind her and use her quick-wit to defeat monsters and gods alike, including the nefarious Hades? Will she finally figure out her place and contribution to the world? Or will her fear of commitment have her running away from an eternity of godhood with Herc?&nbsp;</p> <p>Written by the author of <i>Mirror, Mirror</i> and <i>Conceal, Don't Feel</i>, Jen Calonita's latest twist is sure to delight and surprise.</p>";
