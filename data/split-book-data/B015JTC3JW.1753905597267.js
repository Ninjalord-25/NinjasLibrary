window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Delilah Marlow visits a famous traveling carnival, Metzger's Menagerie, she is an ordinary woman in a not-quite-ordinary world. But under the macabre circus black-top, she discovers a fierce, sharp-clawed creature lurking just beneath her human veneer. Captured and put on exhibition, Delilah is stripped of her worldly possessions, including her own name, as she's forced to \"perform\" in town after town. But there is breathtaking beauty behind the seamy and grotesque reality of the carnival. </p> <p>Gallagher, her handler, is as kind as he is cryptic and strong. The other \"attractions\" - mermaids, minotaurs, gryphons, and kelpies - are strange, yes, but they share a bond forged by the brutal realities of captivity. And as Delilah struggles for her freedom, and for her fellow menagerie, she'll discover a strength and a purpose she never knew existed. </p>";
