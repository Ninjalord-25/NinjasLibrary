window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A belligerent springtide!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Being the most powerful wizard in the world can be a challenge....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>After defending his fledgling realm against the undead lord Gaja Katar all winter long, Count Minalan of the Magelaw faces a new threat in the spring: the Nemovort Shakathet, favored of Korbal, leading the mighty hordes out of the Penumbra. This time, Minalan faces a real strategist; one who drives his armies with purpose and efficiency. The road to war leads through Megelin Castle and the vulnerable lands to the south of Vanado. Old enemies will become allies, and old friends will become valuable assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>War, however, is not what is preoccupying Minalan; the knowledge of the end of the world is. As he broods on existential issues and debates with various goddesses and Alka Alon about Calidoreâ€™s fate, he must overcome his own fears and anxieties and impose order on the situation before everything goes into the chamber pot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The solution? Hire an Arcanist, a specialist in the obscure and trivial, to organize and investigate the many matters Minalan has to manage and bring them to order.</p>";
