What if there were a way for us to never die? Is such a thing even remotely possible? </p> <p>It may not only be feasible; it may very well have been achieved in the distant past. Ancient aliens may well have uncovered the secrets behind slowing, and ultimately completely stopping, the aging process. </p> <p>History is filled with accounts of fantastic beings, powerful gods, and half-human/half-alien entities that had extraordinarily long life-spans. Many such stories are now largely dismissed as nothing more than the stuff of legend, folklore, and mythology. But what if the accounts are all too real? </p> <p>Highlights of <i>Immortality of the Gods</i> include the story of the legendary Anunnaki, how they achieved everlasting life, and why they shared their secrets with Noah, Methuselah, and other biblical figures; the saga of Gilgamesh, a long-lived part-human, part-extraterrestrial Sumerian ruler who was obsessed with immortality; and a study of the claims that one of the reasons for the 2003 invasion of Iraq was to uncover the millennia-old secrets of white powder gold, a manna-like substance that supposedly rejuvenates cells and tissue. </p>";
