window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hyperkinetic and relentlessly inventive, <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i> is Haruki Murakamiâ€™s deep dive into the very nature of consciousness.&nbsp;</p> <p>Across two parallel narratives, Murakami draws listeners into a mind-bending universe in which Lauren Bacall, Bob Dylan, a split-brained data processor, a deranged scientist, his shockingly undemure granddaughter, and various thugs, librarians, and subterranean monsters collide to dazzling effect. What emerges is a novel that is at once hilariously funny and a deeply serious meditation on the nature and uses of the mind.</p>";
