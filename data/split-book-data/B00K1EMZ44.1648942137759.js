window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>On the eve of D-Day, a British secret agent with unique powers goes behind Nazi lines.</b> </p> <p>Michael Gallatin is a British spy with a peculiar talent: the ability to transform himself into a wolf. Although his work in North Africa helped the Allies win the continent in the early days of World War II, he quit the service when a German spy shot his lover in her bed. Now, three years later, the army asks him to end his retirement and parachute into occupied Paris. A mysterious German plan called the Iron Fist threatens the D-Day invasion, and the Nazi in charge is the spy who betrayed Michaelâ€™s lover. The werewolf goes to France for king and country, hoping for a chance at bloody vengeance.</p>";
