window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Inextricably linked with the <i>fatwa</i> called against its author in the wake of the novel’s publication, <i>The Satanic Verses</i> is, beyond that, a rich showcase for Salman Rushdie’s comic sensibilities, cultural observations, and unparalleled mastery of language. The tale of an Indian film star and a Bombay expatriate, Rushdie’s masterpiece was deservedly honored with the Whitbread Prize. </p> <p>The story begins with a bang: the terrorist bombing of a London-bound jet in midflight. Two Indian actors of opposing sensibilities fall to earth, transformed into living symbols of what is angelic and evil. This is just the initial act in a magnificent odyssey that seamlessly merges the actual with the imagined. A book whose importance is eclipsed only by its quality, <i>The Satanic Verses</i> is a key work of our times.</p>";
