What’s a mythological hero to do when he’s forced to become a supervillain to save his world… and himself?</b></p> <p>Colin is a druid on a mission. Namely, traveling to an alternate dimension where technology rules, to snag the tech he needs to save his friends in the Hellpocalypse timeline.</p> <p>At first, it sounds simple. He’ll slip through the timestreams, do a little sightseeing, and go home. Heck, it might even be <i>fun</i> to visit a world where actual superheroes exist.</p> <p>But for creation’s unluckiest druid, nothing is ever easy. When things go horribly wrong, Colin finds that his magic is almost completely on the fritz.</p> <p>To complicate matters, he’s soon mistaken for a supervillain, making enemies with the planet’s most powerful superhero in the process.</p> <p>Stranded in a world where heroes aren’t quite heroic, and where villains have no rights, the druid sees only one path forward…</p> <p>He’ll figure out his powers and clear his name, all while being hunted by every superhero and government agent on the planet.</p> <p>At least there’s an upside—things couldn’t possibly get worse, right?</p> <p>- - -</p> <p><b><i>Superhero World</i></b><b> is the first novel in a planned superhero fantasy fiction trilogy</b> by paranormal and urban fantasy author M.D. Massey.</p> <p>Written in the tradition of gritty, realistic comic book fiction, this series follows in the irreverent footsteps of works such as <i>The Boys</i>, <i>Wild Cards</i>, <i>Watchmen</i>, <i>Invincible</i>, and a long list of other trailblazing sci-fi and fantasy worlds too extensive to reference here.</p> <p>If you enjoy classic superhero fiction with an edge, <b>grab your copy of </b><b><i>Superhero World</i></b><b> today!</b></p>";
