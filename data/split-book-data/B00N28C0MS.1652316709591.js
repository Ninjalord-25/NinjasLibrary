window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The invasion has begun - and a group of teens are caught in the crossfire. I volunteered to be a spy, not an assassin. I know this is warâ€¦but I just want to do what's right. If you ask me, none of us should be here - but no one gave me a choice. And I won't blindly follow orders. I am essential to the plan. And I will be a hero for my country. If I were normal, I wouldn't be old enough to join the army. But I'm not normal. I'm a weapon. We're a perfect match - on and off the battlefield. I hope that means we'll both survive. </p>";
