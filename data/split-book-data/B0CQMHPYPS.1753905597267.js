The sky turned to swirling hues of purplish red and blue, and a thunderclap shook the land. Then there was a blinding flash and a gale force of wind that separated Sloane and Gwyn from each other—and Earth.</p> <p>Now they're on Eona, a world orbited by two moons and populated by elves, orcs, raithes, and other creatures of legend—but no other humans. In this fantastical medieval society, where royals rule and knights protect those in need, Sloane and Gwyn are strange curiosities to those who, separately, found them. While Sloane finds herself fighting alongside the Knights of Haven's Hope, Gwyn's merchant friends have accepted her innocent claim of being a princess. But despite these exciting adventures with their newfound communities, all mother and daughter want to do is reunite with each other.</p> <p>And as Sloane and Gwyn confront dangers on their searching quests, both discover an affinity for magic, a talent just as rare in Eona as the humans who conjure it. When word spreads of a woman who crafts magical items and a \"princess\" who creates fire out of thin air, the noble factions of Eona recognize a threat to the natural order of things—and an opportunity to use the humans to shift the balance of power across the realm.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
