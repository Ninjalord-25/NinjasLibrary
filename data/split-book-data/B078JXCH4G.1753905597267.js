window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The award-winning, critically acclaimed author returns with an ingenious novel about what it would mean to live forever.</p> <p>Rachel has an unusual problem: she can't die. Her recent troubles - widowhood, a failing business, an unemployed middle-aged son - are only the latest. She's already put up with scores of marriages and hundreds of children, over 2,000 years - ever since she made a spiritual bargain to save the life of her first son back in Roman-occupied Jerusalem. There's only one other person in the world who understands: a man she once loved passionately, who has been stalking her through the centuries, convinced they belong together forever.</p> <p>In 2018, as her children and grandchildren develop new technologies for immortality, Rachel knows she must enable her beloved offspring to live fully-without her, but with meaning - by finding a way for herself to die.</p> <p>Gripping, hilarious, and profoundly moving, <i>Eternal Life</i> celebrates the bonds between generations, the power of faith, the purpose of death, and the reasons for being alive.</p>";
