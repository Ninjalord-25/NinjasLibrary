But he’s pulled in so many different directions by his colleagues, a suspicious detective, and the whims of destructive gods that Al begins to wonder: Will he ever find time to write his own happy ending?</p> <p><b>BOOK THREE OF THE INK &amp; SIGIL SERIES</b></p> <p><b>Don’t miss any of Kevin Hearne’s enchanting Ink &amp; Sigil series:<br> INK &amp; SIGIL • PAPER &amp; BLOOD • CANDLE &amp; CROW</b></p>";
