window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Missing teens. Long-lost magic. Can one determined private eye topple a dark conspiracy?</b></p> <p>Detective for hire, Ashira Cohen is having a no-good, very bad day.</p> <p>When Ash was 13, her con artist father disappeared, leaving her with emotional scars and a limp she can't hide. But she toughened up, determined never to be played again. Is history repeating itself?</p> <p>First, she’s hit on the head during a stakeout, revealing a mysterious tattoo on the back of her skull.</p> <p>Even worse? It’s a now-broken ward unleashing dangerous magic that as a Mundane, she shouldn’t possess.</p> <p>And the icing on this crap cake? Her unruly powers nearly kill her long-time nemesis, Levi, the uptight leader of the magic community. One word from him revealing her forbidden abilities, and everything she’s built will be taken from her…by force.</p> <p>The only bright spot is that Levi requires her supernatural skills to solve a spree of abductions. After years of being underestimated by him, it’s Ash’s chance at payback and she’s going to enjoy bringing him to his knees — or stuffing him in a body bag.</p> <p><b>Crackling with humor and suspense,</b><b><i> Blood &amp; Ash</i></b><b> features a headstrong heroine tackling paranormal conspiracies and an enemies-to-lovers romance. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>\"Wilde combines hardboiled noir and Jewish folklore in this action-packed, perfectly paced paranormal romp.... the real star is Ash's hilariously snarky narrative voice which is archly sarcastic but never mean.... Wilde balances exuberant wit with deep compassion and handles Ash's chronic pain and fragmented family with care. This giddy, sexy series launch is a delight.\" (</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>, Starred Review)</b>&nbsp;</p>";
