window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I know what goes bump in the night, but it's humans that are the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead of using my powers as a Reader to work the psychic network hotlines, I work as a field agent for the clandestine agency, AIR. My elven partner Logan is showing me the ropes. Relocating a troll and interviewing a werewolf should be a normal day. When shots are fired and a fairy turns up dead, our day turns into a nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>My job keeping the Lost hidden from the world takes a U-turn into an investigation. Using my powers, I have a shot at tracking the killer, but someone else has the same idea. An agency sanctioned assassin mistakes me for a demon and almost succeeds in taking me off the case and out of life. These are my tax dollars at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With my powers raging out of control and a target on my back, will I be able to protect the Lost?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If you love urban fantasy or supernatural suspense, the AIR series will keep you listening!</p>";
