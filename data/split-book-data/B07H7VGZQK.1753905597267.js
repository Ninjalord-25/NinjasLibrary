Over a half-century later, the mummified corpses of three crewmen, wrapped in a decaying rubber raft, come to light during excavation for a new shopping development.

Together, he and Shadrach Aydlett will discover what actually happened in the Carolina sand hills so long ago, and what everyone's really after...tons of long-lost Nazi gold. And finally, he’ll battle a ruthless killer many fathoms beneath the stormy sea off Cape Hatteras. </p>";
