Come read about a lonely albino Bigfoot - being stalked in the forests of northern California - a Bigfoot and his dog - rockhounding in Nevada with the Big Guy - the Bigfoot who tried to stop the BASE jumpers - and many more great campfire tales! And best of all, you'll marvel at the recent discovery of a cave where Bigfoots possibly recorded their history and language! 18 stories...but only if you dare... </p> <p>\"I've spent a lot of my life sitting around a campfire, swapping stories with my fishing clients. We always have fun, but sometimes we don't sleep too well afterwards.\" (Rusty Wilson)</p>";
