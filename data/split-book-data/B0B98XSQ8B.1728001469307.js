window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Miss Mildred Percy inherits a dragon.</b></p> <p>Ah, but we’ve already got ahead of ourselves…</p> <p>Miss Mildred Percy is a spinster. She does not dance, she has long stopped dreaming, and she certainly does not have adventures. That is, until her great uncle has the audacity to leave her an inheritance, one that includes a dragon’s egg.</p> <p>The egg—as eggs are wont to do—decides to hatch, and Miss Mildred Percy is suddenly thrust out of the role of “spinster and general wallflower” and into the unprecedented position of “spinster and keeper of dragons.”</p> <p>But England has not seen a dragon since…well, <i>ever</i>. And now Mildred must contend with raising a dragon (that should not exist), kindling a romance (with a humble vicar), and embarking on an adventure she never thought could be hers for the taking.</p>";
