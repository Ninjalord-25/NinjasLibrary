window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the best-selling author of The Misadventures of the Laundry Hag series comes a new mystery series of mouthwatering proportions... </p> <p><b>Pretty please with spaghetti on top?</b> </p> <p>Andy Buckland has always dreamed of being a chef. But after a live studio audience is stricken with food poisoning during her debut cooking show, she finds herself blacklisted in the culinary community. The only job open to her is working in her family's southern pasta shop, and, to make matters worse, her first assignment is serving baked ziti to her former lover and his spoiled bride-to-be at their engagement party! But a broken heart and a bruised ego are the least of Andy's troubles when she discovers a dead body at the party with the words \"welcome home\" written in flour next to it. Is it a warning? A threat? Or a frame-up job? Andy is determined to find out. With the help of her over-the-top Italian family, Andy will prove that she has what it takes to not only cook the best dish in town but also catch a killer, too! </p> <p><b>Recipes included!</b> </p>";
