He is a robot of leisure and idle political meddling - a retirement well-earned. Or he was, until a human girl named Eve was dropped in his lap.</p> <p>Geneticists have restored Earth’s biome and begun repopulation. But primate cloning is in its infancy; human cloning is banned.</p> <p>Far from a failed genetics experiment, Eve is brilliant, curious, and heartbreakingly naïve about her species’ history. But Eve’s creator wants her back and has a gruesome fate planned for her. There is only one robot qualified to protect her. For the first time in a thousand years, Charlie7 has a human race to protect.</p> <p>A.I. didn’t destroy humanity.</p> <p>It didn’t save us, either.</p> <p>The robots we built in our final days preserved human minds. They survived the end of life on Earth and embarked on the greatest single project in all recorded history.</p> <p>They rebuilt.</p> <p>The result of 1,000 years of genetic engineering, terraforming, and painstaking toxic cleanup has resulted in the ultimate achievement of the Post-Invasion Age: a healthy human.</p> <p>Her name is Eve14.</p> <p>Don’t ask about the 13 Eves before her.</p> <p>Or do, because that’s the reason why she’s in danger, and why one brave robot puts his millennium-long life on the line to save her.</p> <p><b>Welcome </b><b><i>back</i></b><b> to the Golden Age of science fiction, when scientists had planet-size dreams and robots were robots.</b></p> <p><b>Grab your copy while there’s still an Earth left.</b></p>";
