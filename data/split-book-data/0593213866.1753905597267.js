A chillingly charismatic aristocrat. And a brave socialite drawn to expose their treacherous secrets. . . . From the author of </b><b><i>Gods of Jade and Shadow</i></b><b> comes “a terrifying twist on classic gothic horror” (</b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b>) set in glamorous 1950s Mexico.</b><br> <br> After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone to save her from a mysterious doom, Noemí Taboada heads to High Place, a distant house in the Mexican countryside. She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region. <br> <br> Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemi’s dreams with visions of blood and doom.<br> <br> Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family’s youngest son. Shy and gentle, he seems to want to help Noemí, but might also be hiding dark knowledge of his family’s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place. The family’s once colossal wealth and faded mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as Noemí digs deeper she unearths stories of violence and madness. <br> <br> And Noemí, mesmerized by the terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever leave this enigmatic house behind.<br> <br> <b>“It’s as if a supernatural power compels us to turn the pages of the gripping </b><b><i>Mexican Gothic</i></b><b>.”—</b><b><i>The Washington Post<br> <br> </i></b><b>“Mexican Gothic is the perfect summer horror read, and marks Moreno-Garcia with her hypnotic and engaging prose as one of the genre’s most exciting talents.”</b><b><i>—Nerdist<br> <br> </i></b><b>“A period thriller as rich in suspense as it is in lush ’50s atmosphere.”</b><b><i>—Entertainment Weekly</i></b></p>";
