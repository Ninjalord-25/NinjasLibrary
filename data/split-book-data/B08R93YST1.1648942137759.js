window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Love is even more dangerous behind bars.</b></p> <p><b>Ava-Marie</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>My name is Ava-Marie, and I <i>love</i> living on the dark side.</p> <p>Getting into trouble is kind of my thing, but one night, I take revenge too far. I’m sentenced to a reform school for magical delinquents...though really, it’s a prison.</p> <p>As the only supernatural who can control both fire and water, I’m already a target. To make matters worse, I literally share a soul with Charlie, a sexy inmate from the wrong side of the tracks. Surviving at the Institute is almost as risky as falling in love.</p> <p>But there’s a way out. The warden is offering a pardon for the team who wins the Darke Games - a sick, twisted competition where more prisoners come out dead than alive.&nbsp;</p> <p>They think I'm the bad guy. I'm about to show them just how much of a villain I can be.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Charlie</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>I shouldn’t be at the Institute. I’m in here because of her - the girl who claims to own half my soul.</p> <p>After losing my sight, I grew up as an orphan, banished from magical society. I learned enough on the streets to survive the gangs and fight clubs inside the prison. But nothing could prepare me for the Darke Games.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ava-Marie is my worst enemy, but if we’re going to break out of here, we’ll have to get along. Yet, the more I let Ava in, the more I want her. I can’t let my desire for her get in the way of my one chance at escape.&nbsp;</p> <p>Except, it already has. There’s a dark power inside of Ava that terrifies me....</p> <p>And none of us will be prepared when it unleashes.</p>";
