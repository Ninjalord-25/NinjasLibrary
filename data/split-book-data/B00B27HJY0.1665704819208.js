window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joy Randall's Top-five tips for vampire hunters:</p> <ul> <li>Location, location, location. Vampires won't be caught dead (ha!) in places like discos, 10-minute lube shops, or Switzerland. Remember, if you wouldn't be there, neither would a bloodsucker.</li> <li>Trust your eyes. You know the handsome, annoyingly arrogant, self-assured man in the shadows with long hair and a cleft in his chin? He's your vampire.</li> <li>No matter how tempting it might be, do not \"accidentally\" acquire a paper cut on your finger and suggest your vampire kiss it to make it better.</li> <li>Play it cool. Don't offer to accompany your prince of the night on the talk-show circuit, and whatever you do, don't offer him your heart!</li> <li>Most of all, remember: being a vampire is nothing to laugh about.</li> </ul>";
