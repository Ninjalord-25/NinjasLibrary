This one you're about to read is for Patient number 1024.</p> <p>He's known on my ward as Ken from the famous \"Ken and Barbie\" duo. They were the Bonnie &amp; Clyde in the Asylum. His confession is included in <i>The Asylum Confessions: Book 1</i>.</p> <p>Fans of Stephen King, Joe Hill, and those who can't get enough stories about serial killers are going to enjoy listening to the deathbed confessions from the asylum.</p> <p>My name is Jack Steen, and for those who arrive on my \"death\" ward at the asylum, I'm the last face many will see before they die. I am the night nurse at the Asylum for the Criminally Insane.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most of my patients are serial killers and mass murderers, and they know me as the Angel of Death. When they come onto my floor, I offer a deal: tell me their story, their \"untold\" story that hasn't been read about in the news, sensationalized by media, or cataloged in a ridiculous number of academic papers. I want the real story - the one they haven't old anyone.</p> <p>Some of these killers have never confessed to their crimes, some kept certain information to themselves...those are the stories I want. If they give them to me, I'll make their death...easier. They're already dying, that's why they're now my patients.</p> <p>If they play nice, I can make their death less painful. But only if they play nice and tell me their confessions. The majority of these killers are expert manipulators. I realize they could be playing me and messing with my head.</p> <p><b>It's a chance I'm willing to take. And now...they might just be playing with yours, too.</b></p>";
