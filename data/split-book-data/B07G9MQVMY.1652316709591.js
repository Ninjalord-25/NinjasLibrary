window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Reading David Luddington is “Like reading your favourite sitcom.” </i></b> <b>– Nigel Planer</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>“</b><b><i>The funniest book of the year.” </i></b> <b>– Claire Ashton, Editor, the Book Reviewer.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Retired stage magician turned professional mystic debunker, John Barker, finds his sceptical beliefs under fire when he encounters a strange man who claims to be Merlin. After several unsuccessful attempts to rid himself of his increasingly unpredictable companion, John finally relents and agrees to assist in the man’s crazy mission, to find the true grave of the mythical King Arthur. Following a hidden code contained within the text of a soft porn novel, they gather a growing entourage of hippies, mystic seekers and alien hunters as they leave a trail of chaos across the south west of England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When the group comes to the attention of a TV Reality Show producer looking to make a fast profit out of harmless eccentrics and fading celebrities, John decides it’s time to take charge and prove one way or the other, the identity of this mysterious person who claims to be a fictional wizard. <i>Whose Reality Is This Anyway?</i> is a warm-hearted tale of what it means to be an individual and to follow one’s dreams. With his trademark cast of oddball characters and absurd situations, David Luddington once more transports us into a world where who you are is more important than what you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>“</b><b><i>David Luddington epitomizes the elusive quality of writing that he perpetuates - the British Comedy.” </i></b> <b>– Grady Harp</b></p>";
