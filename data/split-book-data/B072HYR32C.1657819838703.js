window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A special middle grade debut of magic and courage in a world of witches, written with the charm and enchantment of books like <i>Circus Mirandus</i> and <i>The Apothecary</i>. </p> <p>Will Arianwyn ever become a real witch? </p> <p>Arianwyn has flunked her witch's assessment. She knows she's doomed. Declared an apprentice and sent to the town of Lull in disgrace, Arianwyn may never become a real witch like everyone else - much to the glee of her archrival, Gimma. </p> <p>But the remote Lull is not as boring as it seems. Strange things are being sighted in the woods, and a dangerous infestation of hex creeps throughout the town. Then the worst thing Arianwyn can imagine arrives in Lull: Gimma turns up on vacation determined to make her life miserable. </p> <p>Despite being a little over her head, Arianwyn starts to get the hang of being a witch, even if she's only an apprentice. But there's one thing she's wrong about: The worst is still to come. For a mysterious darkness has begun to haunt her spells, and there may be much more at stake than just her pride.... </p>";
