window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A wanderer. An outcast. A queen.</b></p> <p>Against the customs of the land, Kigal is amongst the few still willing to bury the dead. It is a life that has left her wandering, without friend or home, but she spreads her message of justice for the deceased wherever she can. However, when targeted by those who loathe her, she narrowly escapes execution and tumbles into the Underworld.</p> <p>There, Kigal is met with the impossible: the souls of the dead proclaiming her as their goddess, fated to be Queen of the Underworld. Hurled into a world beyond her imagining, clashing with seductive gods and bringing demons to heel, she must fight to bring justice to the forgotten dead. Yet, as an ancient evil rises in the Land of the Living, Kigal must not only fight for the lives of those who sought her ruin, but for their very souls.</p> <p><b><i>Queen of Shades</i></b><b> is the first in a Mesopotamian fantasy series.</b></p>";
