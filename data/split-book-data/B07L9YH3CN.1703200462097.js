window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you mix Sword Art Online and The Land, and make them both darker - Project Chrysalis is what you get in this new Gamelit series.</p> <p>Chrysalis is the project of the century. It’s a hyper-realistic fantasy RPG set in the Middle Ages. Chrysalis is a perfect virtual reality game where every orphan under governmental care is placed in an in-game family to finally obtain all the love and care from the parents which kids need so desperately. But for one orphan who took part in this program something went horribly wrong.</p> <p>Instead of a happy childhood Anji suffers from demonification. Being betrayed for the sake of someone else's master plan he finds himself in the most hopeless place of Chrysalis: Hell which is full of bloodthirsty demons, agony, and despair.</p> <p>Sagie (Anji’s in-game username), empowered by homesickness and revenge, will go through Hell to face those who’ve taken everything from him. Cruel gods, bloody demons and game officers whose purpose is to keep order and safe balance, who will do their best to stop him on his crusade. The road will be long and gruesome. Blessed are those who struggle.</p>";
