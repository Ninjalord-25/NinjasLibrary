window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Land-ho!</p> <p>Clyde and co. have finally—finally—made it to the City of Darkness. Which turns out to actually exist!</p> <p>One small problem though. Anyone and anything that sets foot on the island immediately disappears. Ceases to exist. Poof.</p> <p>To complete the quest, Clyde needs to figure out how to actually enter the city and steal the crown jewels . . . without getting stuck in the town forever. It's a foreboding, dark place (obviously), where corruption is rampant. And maybe worse: the game rules Clyde's gotten so good at bending to his will? They don't seem to apply.</p> <p>Darktown Funk is a riveting story full of wild twists, close calls, and deep lore. You'll stay up all night with this sensational LitRPG adventure!</p>";
