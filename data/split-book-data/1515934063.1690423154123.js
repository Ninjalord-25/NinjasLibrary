window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>You know that squirmy sensation in your gut when you have no idea what you're doing and you're about to screw everything up?</b></p> <p><b>Yeah, that feeling.</b></p> <p>I thought I was a good judge of character, but recent events proved me very wrong. Now, in a brilliant demonstration of my newfound caution, I'm putting all my faith in a demon - a demon who's tried to kill me before. The squirmy feeling is making sense, right?</p> <p>Unfortunately, I don't have any other options. Ezra's time is almost up, which means I need answers and I need them fast. So it's time to toughen up, pack my gear, and find me one of the most illegal, reviled, and scarce mythics out there: a demon-mage summoner.</p> <p>And all I have to do is follow a demon's instructions on where to look. How could that go wrong?</p> <p>Make sure to check out the companion series, The Guild Codex: Demonized, available now, and The Guild Codex: Warped, coauthored by Rob Jacobsen, available summer 2020.</p>";
