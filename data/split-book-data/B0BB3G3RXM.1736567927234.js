I devoured this book and loved every page' NICK EAMES, bestselling author of </b><b><i>Kings of the Wylde</i></b><br> <br> <b>From the bestselling author of THE GREATCOATS: seven war mages with dark pasts must come together to fight an unknown enemy - but the stakes are higher than anyone can imagine . . . and someone's setting the seven up for a fall.</b><br> <b> </b><br> <b> </b>Picture a wizard. Go ahead, close your eyes. There he is, see? Skinny old guy with a long straggly beard. The hat's a must, too, right? Big, floppy thing. Wouldn't want a simple steel helmet or something that might, you know, protect the part of him most needed for conjuring magical forces from being bashed in with a mace (or pretty much any household object).<br> <br> Yep. Behold the mighty wizard.<br> <br> Now open your eyes and let me show you what a <i>real</i> war mage looks like . . . but be warned: you're probably not going to like it, because we're violent, angry, dangerously broken people who sell our skills to the highest bidder and be damned to any moral or ethical considerations.<br> <br> My name is Cade Ombra, and though I currently make my living as a mercenary wonderist, I used to have a far more noble-sounding job title - until I discovered the people I worked for weren't quite as noble as I'd believed. Now I'm on the run and my only friend, a homicidal thunder mage, has invited me to join him on a suicide mission against the seven deadliest mages on the continent.<br> <br> <b>Time to recruit some very bad people to help us on this job . . .</b><br> <br> </p>";
