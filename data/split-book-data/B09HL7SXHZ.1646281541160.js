window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Former Potions Master-in-training Elizabeth Grace Sloan left the paranormal world - and her magic - behind more than 20 years ago to go off and see the mortal world. She married a mortal and had two wonderful children. Now, her firefighter husband is dead, killed in a tragic house fire when the ceiling collapsed on top of him. With nothing left to tie her to the mortal world, Elizabeth packs up her kids and moves home to the paranormal sanctuary town of Fairweather Falls, where the magic, the family, and the love she left behind wait for her still.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Arriving at the house her aunt left to her when she passed, Elizabeth finds her family waiting for her. It seems her aunt's death wasn't natural, and there is something - or someone - stalking her aunt's old friends. Elizabeth's life is suddenly overly full, as she balances her children's awakened magical abilities, starting a new business, relearning her own magic, and solving a case of serial murders that spans the last 40 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>And then there's her lost love, now the town police liaison and detective, new friends, and an old friend to save from an overbearing mother who controls her life with an iron fist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Who said coming home was easy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This is book one in a spin-off series from the Valerian's Cove series. Characters from Valerian's Cove will make appearances, as will the town itself.</p>";
