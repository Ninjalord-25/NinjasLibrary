For generations, the inn has protected all who seek refuge within its walls, and any who disrupt the peace can never return.</p> <p>For Maddie Morrow, summers at the inn are more than a chance to experience this magic firsthand. Havenfall is an escape from reality, where her mother sits on death row accused of murdering Maddie’s brother. It’s where Maddie fell in love with handsome Fiorden soldier Brekken.

With Brekken missing, her uncle gravely injured and a dangerous creature on the loose, Maddie suddenly finds herself responsible for the safety of everyone in Havenfall. She’ll do anything to uncover the truth, even if it means working together with an alluring new staffer Taya, who seems to know more than she’s letting on. As dark secrets are revealed about the inn itself, one thing becomes clear to Maddie - no one can be trusted, and no one is safe....</p> <p>Sara Holland takes the lush fantasy that captured listeners in <i>Everless </i>and <i>Evermore </i>and weaves it into the real world to create a wholly captivating new series where power and peril lurk behind every door.</p>";
