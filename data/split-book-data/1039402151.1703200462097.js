window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>If you have to be stuck in a curse with monsters, they might as well be sexy monsters.</b></p> <p>When I answered an ad for a caretaker at Saint Mark’s Sanctuary, I thought I’d be dusting chandeliers and polishing floors. I didn’t expect to be tricked into a curse, going into debt to a monster, and being forced to take a self-paced “let’s learn magic” course so I can fix a 2,000-year-old problem.</p> <p>And that monster? Not your ordinary, everyday beast. He has hooves, and horns, and fur on his legs. But you know where he doesn’t have fur? Yeah. <i>There. </i>Which is fine. Except he doesn’t wear pants.</p> <p>Nothing at Saint Mark’s is exactly what it seems. The entire inside is magic, the hallways upstairs are nothing but parties from the past, and the super-hot guy who lives in the dungeon? Yeah.<i> Not human.</i></p> <p>My name is Pie, and all I want is to be a normal girl with an average life. I refuse to get stuck in this curse. I refuse to learn magic to break it. And there is no way in hell I will fall in love with a monster. <i>Famous. Last. Words.</i></p>";
