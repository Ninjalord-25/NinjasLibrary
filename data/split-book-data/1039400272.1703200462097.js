window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The things that go </b><b><i>bump</i></b><b> in the night are supposed to be headboards, not monsters. </b></p> <p>Leaving my husband was hard. Trying to face the world alone with my teenage daughter is the sort of thing nightmares are made of, but I caught a break. My best friend just hired me for a great job. It's not anything special; simply managing the leasing office of this very fancy and highly exclusive neighborhood, yet the perks mean I get my second chance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speaking of perks, my rent-free house is right beside not just one handsome man, but five! Each one is hotter than the last, and all of them seem interested in me. Maybe I can't remember the last date I was on, but if I want to master being a strong woman, then this is a good place to start. It's just dating, right? Normal life stuff. Not so much.&nbsp;</p> <p>Everyone around us has these strange golden eyes...and there are the questions no one will answer. And who cares if there's a lot of wildlife running around at night? I do, especially when a wolf keeps sneaking into my backyard. I have a kid to worry about. Things have got to change before someone gets bitten!&nbsp;</p> <p>Normal is going out the window, and fast.&nbsp;</p> <p>My neighbors say I don't belong here, and they don't mean because I'm Hispanic. Never mind that I just heard a man growl. Now they're talking about fated somethings, and I'm pretty sure they mean me. I feel like I'm going crazy! Because when I said I wanted to learn how to be strong, this wasn't what I meant at all. Still, when it comes to taking care of my little girl, I will definitely learn how to be the biggest bitch on the block.&nbsp;</p> <p>I just hope that doesn't become literal.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Wolves Next Door series contains some profanity and mature content. </i></p>";
