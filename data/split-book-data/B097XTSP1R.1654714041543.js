window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Game of Thrones meets Harry Potter&nbsp;</p> <p>Bathgate's richly imagined epic fantasy series immerses the listener in a vibrant magical world whose peace has been shattered. The struggles of the people of the Ceniac Island are viewed through deeply dimensioned characters with massive battles and epic wizard duels.&nbsp;</p> <p>Victory comes from understanding what magic will allow and what it will punish. While the violence plays out, there is a mystery secretly driving the war buried beneath a barren landscape where no creature lives, not even plants or insects. The ancients have buried something which will grant godlike power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In places, this is an adult dark fantasy or a sexy swords-and-sorcery like Game of Thrones, but the innocence of the protagonist is heartwarming and enriching.&nbsp;</p>";
