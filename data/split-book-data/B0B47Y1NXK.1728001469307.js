A new start.&nbsp;</p> <p>But farm life doesn’t come easy, as Jason will learn. With a mountain of chores that range from monster extermination to watering crops, Jason will need to learn to manage his stamina, build up his endurance, and maintain a social life if he’s going to live the quiet life in the country.</p> <p><b>Get a copy of this nostalgic coziness and set off on a warm adventure!</b></p>";
