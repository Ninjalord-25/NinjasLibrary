Sidelined from action, he's forced to reevaluate his feelings. Sadly for him, it's a luxury he can ill afford. </p> <p>An unstoppable terror from the dawn of time has awoken deep beneath the Earth and is headed his way. To make matters worse, he's been deemed a traitor by those he thought to be his allies. Now he finds himself fighting off enemies from all sides while warring with his emotions. Talk about sucky timing for introspection. </p> <p>As the world crumbles to pieces around him, Bill must muster his courage, master his powers, and rise to the destiny he's been trying so long to deny - because if he doesn't, his love life will be the least of his worries. </p>";
