Nope, I still need an education. Except the classes at Fallen University are on things like “Curses and Hexcraft” and “Magical Combat”.</p> <p>It’s not all bad. There are these four hot as hell guys I keep bumping into - Kingston, Jayce, Xero, and Kai. I’m not sure if I should trust them; they’ve each got secrets of their own, and they’re definitely dangerous.</p> <p>But that craving I’ve been having?&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s pulling me right toward them.</p> <p>Yup, things are about to get real interesting at FU.</p>";
