window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Miles Landry is trying to put violence behind him when he&nbsp;takes up work as a private detective focused on humdrum adultery cases. But&nbsp;when a Tibetan monk&nbsp;hires him to find a missing person, things get weird&nbsp;fast.</p> <p>Charged with tracking down the reincarnation of a man possessed by a demonic&nbsp;guardian from the&nbsp;<i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, Miles is plunged into a world of&nbsp;fortune-tellers, gangsters, and tantric rituals. The year is 1991, and a series of grisly murders has&nbsp;rocked New York City in the run&nbsp;up to a visit from the Dalai Lama.</p> <p>The police&nbsp;attribute the killings to Chinatown gang warfare. Miles - skeptical of the&nbsp;supernatural - is inclined to agree. But&nbsp;what if the monster he's hunting is&nbsp;more than a myth?</p> <p><i>Proudly represented by Crystal Lake Publishing - Tales from the Darkest Depths.</i></p> <p>Interview with the author:</p> <p>What makes this horror/noir novel so special?</p> <p>I’ve always been attracted to mashups of my favorite genres. I think what makes&nbsp;<i>The Wind in My Heart&nbsp;</i>special is that it takes the best of both worlds from crime novels and horror thrillers and adds a dash of the supernatural with a Tibetan twist. I’d like to think it’s a unique cocktail.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tell us more about your lead character.</p> <p>Miles Landry is a private detective with a short fuse and a black sense of humor. He’s suffered some personal losses that have left him pretty hardened. He’s a pragmatic ex-military man who views the world with a skeptical eye. But he also tries to keep an open mind when his clients have an open wallet. So it's interesting to see what happens when a group of Buddhist monks hires him to solve a supernatural mystery. His world view is bound to clash with theirs, but he may learn something along the way.</p> <p>Why should (listeners) give this book or your work a try?</p> <p>So much of supernatural horror and thriller fiction is based on Judeo-Christian premises. I wanted to explore a different perspective on gods, demons, and the afterlife, and to contrast that with a very American setting. The result is a violent, urban occult thriller with the voice of a classic noir. It’s a quick, entertaining listen with some deep philosophical roots that have interested me for decades.</p>";
