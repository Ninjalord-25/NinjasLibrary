Initially glad to have escaped her old existence, she quickly realizes that this new one might not be much better. Her new body is too frail to follow any grand dreams of adventure, her new mind is too dulled to allow any meticulous planning or thought, and this new, seemingly colorful, kind world is anything but.</p> <p>Needing to find a way to survive in this horrible place, Fresh bands together with some unusual people as she undergoes an entirely unexpected challenge; running an item shop just outside of the dungeon!</p>";
