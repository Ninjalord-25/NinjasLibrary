As a result, <i>nuclear Armageddon hangs over us like a mighty sword</i>. </p> <p>Military analysts agree that the United States can't start World War III. Why? We might lose. Sabers are rattling and the war of words escalate between America and her enemies, but the rhetoric has done little to stop the nuclear proliferation of North Korea and Iran. When the deep state, a close-knit group of powerful, influential people within our government challenges a new, untested President, things go awry. </p> <p>The decisions made in the darkened rooms of Washington have a profound impact on ordinary Americans like the Armstrong family, Texas ranchers who spend their time making a living, but also preparing for the worst. As most of the family lives their life in Texas, one of them will unknowingly be the catalyst for World War III. </p> <p><b>About the Lone Star Series </b></p> <p>Political suspense collides with post-apocalyptic thriller fiction with the Lone Star Series by Bestselling Author Bobby Akart.
