From a stunning opening, the sense of dread just builds and builds.” (M. R. Carey, author of </b><b><i>The Girl with All the Gifts</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"Odd and dark and fascinating.... Not quite like anything I've ever read before. A strange, compelling, late-night page-turner. It kept me reading way past my bedtime.\" (T. Kingfisher, author of </b><b><i>The Hollow Places</i></b><b>)</b><br> <br> <i>Possession is an addiction.</i></p> <p>Sydney's spent years burying her past and building a better life for herself and her young son.

Of dashing out a broken window. Of running into her neighbors' yard and calling the police.</p> <p>The cops tell her a different story. Because the intruder is now lying dead in her guest room - murdered in a way that looks intimately personal.</p> <p>Sydney can't remember killing the man. No one believes her.</p> <p>Back home, as horrific memories surface, an unnatural darkness begins whispering in her ear. Urging her back to old addictions and a past she's buried to build a better life for herself and her son.</p> <p>As Sydney searches for truth among the wreckage of a past that won't stay buried for long, the unquiet darkness begins to grow. To change into something unimaginable.</p> <p>To reveal terrible cravings of its own.</p>";
