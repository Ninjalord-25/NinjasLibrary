Many whisper of its existence, but few have found this place, where magic and pleasure abound. There, the mysterious Thief King reigns supreme with the help of the Mousai, a trio of revered and feared sorceresses.</p> <p>Larkyra Bassette may be the youngest of the Mousai, but when she sings her voice has the power to slay monsters. When it’s discovered the Duke of Lachlan is siphoning a poisonous&nbsp;drug from the Thief Kingdom and using it to abuse his tenants,&nbsp;Larkyra is offered her first solo mission to stop the duke. Eager to prove herself, Larkyra accepts by posing as the duke’s potential bride. But her plans grow complicated when she finds herself drawn to Lord Darius Mekenna,&nbsp;Lachlan’s rightful heir.

Larkyra and Darius must learn to trust each other if there is to be&nbsp;any hope of saving&nbsp;the people of Lachlan - and themselves.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of Aadilor, where lords and ladies can be murderers and thieves, and the most alluring notes are often the deadliest.
