window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The adventure begins in the first Dan Kotler archaeological thriller!</b></p> <p>An ancient medallion is unearthed in Pueblo, Colorado, revealing a secret that will rewrite the history of North America - the Vikings somehow made it to the continent's interior, centuries before Columbus made landfall, and there they built a city of gold.</p> <p>But today the Coelho medallion has been stolen, and a linguist and researcher has been abducted in connection with the crime. Could the abductors be after the fabled city of gold? Or do they have a more sinister plot in mind?</p> <p>Dan Kotler is an independent researcher who often finds himself in more trouble than he was expecting. But when his colleague is abducted and he finds himself being investigated by the FBI, he must use all of his brilliance and expertise to find her and absolve himself.</p> <p>Anwar Adham has plans for a terrorist action on US soil, and information from the Pueblo research site can give him everything he needs to put his plans in motion. Unless Adham is stopped, thousands and possibly millions will die.</p> <p>Whoever wins this contest of wits and wills will hold the fate of thousands in his hands, and will also lay claim to the fabled city of gold.</p> <p>It's an adventure that can redefine the history of America as we know it. Kotler finds himself facing off against both the FBI and Adham's terrorist network as he struggles to solve the mystery of Vikings in Colorado, to rescue Evelyn, and stop Adham's plans before it's too late.</p>";
