I have no wings, I’m afraid to use my magic, and not even my best friend knows I’ve never had a lover.&nbsp;</p> <p>My parents are hellbent on mating me to a high society dragon. Before I can even consider marriage, I need to get back to the Ukrainian orphanage and figure out what the hell happened to me when I was a kid.</p> <p>But nothing’s ever simple.&nbsp;</p> <p>The orphanage sits dead center in the Transcarpathian Mountains - and any Magical who dares approach risks losing their powers to the Dragon King.</p> <p>Can I find the answers that release my wings?
