window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My idea of a party is hanging out with a mini box of wine and a raccoon. So yeah, I need a life.</p> <p>When I’m accused of murder, things get wild. One, I learn that I have magic. Two, there’s a secret magical city hidden right in London itself. And three, the only one who can help me is a vampire who’s sexy as sin and scary as the devil himself. He's called the Devil of Darkvale and he all but owns Guild City.</p> <p>My life is on the line if I don’t solve the murder, which means surviving in this new world of witch parties, magical guilds, and a vampire with a tortured past. He drives me insane, but if I want to save my own life, he’s also my only hope.</p>";
