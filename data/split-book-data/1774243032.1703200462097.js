window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After bonding with Dawnbringer, the Sacred Sword of Light, Keras Selyrian travels to the nation of Edria to compete in the Tournament of the Sacred Sword. The winner of the tournament will be given a chance to fight for the Sacred Sword of Stone if they can defeat the current wielder, the impossibly powerful Emperor of Edria, in single combat.</p> <p>Winning the tournament will be no simple endeavor. To succeed, Keras will have to face representatives from every nation, other foreign travelers of great skill, his own allies, other sacred sword wielders...and even a familiar face from his past.</p> <p>But the tournament itself won't be the only challenge.</p> <p>When tournament contestants are found dead, Keras discovers the telltale signs of a familiar type of enemy - one that even his own formidable powers might fail to match.</p> <p>Author's note: This book is designed to set the foundation for plot and character arcs for several books to come, and this means that by necessity, there will be a number of elements introduced in this book that aren't resolved by the end. This is intentional, but it may not work for all listeners. If you prefer stories that feel self-contained, you may be best waiting for at least one more book to come out to listen to them back-to-back.</p>";
