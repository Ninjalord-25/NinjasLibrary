One of the elite class of brave souls who travel Eldaria and fight the blight of monsters wherever they are found.</p> <p>Picture rippling muscles, clad in magical armor, perhaps, artfully splattered with the viscera of foes smote in twain. Or...ooh...alternatively, a severely tasteful robe, dusted - equally artfully - with the ashes of enemies immolated with eldritch fyre. </p> <p>Now picture these paragons of heroism sitting astride their muscled warhorses, surrounded by the cheering, garland-throwing peasants of a hamlet they have saved from the blight. Now, throw that image out, because this isn’t that story.</p> <p>Instead, picture a group of adventurers who are not skilled, have slain nothing, don’t own any armor worth burnishing and would probably misspell \"eldritch\" if given a chance. While the saying holds true that \"everybody has to start at zero\", it might also be posited that this misfit band of eager wannabes are starting somewhere in the negative.</p> <p>Bards are not going to be composing any epic ballads about their exploits anytime soon, unless it's in the form of a cautionary tale. But despite all these setbacks, they are destined to save the world, right? No. But they might, anyway.</p>";
