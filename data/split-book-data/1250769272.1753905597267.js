window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Award-winning author Adrian Tchaikovsky's </b><b><i>Made Things</i></b><b> is dark fantasy tale of how the most unlikely characters may become the most heroic. </b><br> <br> <b>Making friends has never been so important.</b></p> <p>Welcome to Fountains Parish - a cesspit of trade and crime, where ambition curls up to die and desperation grows on its cobbled streets like mold on week-old bread. </p> <p>Coppelia is a street thief, a trickster, a low-level con artist. But she has something other thieves don't...tiny puppet-like companions: some made of wood, some of metal. They don't entirely trust her, and she doesn't entirely understand them, but their partnership mostly works.</p> <p>After a surprising discovery shakes their world to the core, Coppelia and her friends must re-examine everything they thought they knew about their world, while attempting to save their city from a seemingly impossible new threat.</p>";
