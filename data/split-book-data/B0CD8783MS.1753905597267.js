Horses were being replaced by cars. Laws were changing how Bertram could deliver justice. Wanting to live out his golden years in peace, Stone flees to the quiet town of Hamilton, Texas, where he becomes the local sheriff. In a small town where the law rarely needs enforcing, everything is going according to his planâ€”until a great evil plunges Hamilton into horror.</p> <p>On the outskirts of town, in a small community called Deer Hollow, there is a ramshackle cabin where a man lives by the name of Eli Snow. He is a recluse, living away from other people. Nobody knows about the secret terror he has kept hidden away for years. A nightmare that is about to be unleashed.</p>";
