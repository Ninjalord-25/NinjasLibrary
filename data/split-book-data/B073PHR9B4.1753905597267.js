window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Giving a ride to a teenage girl hitchhiking in the middle of nowhere can be a bad idea, especially if they slip into the back seat unseen - because they're a lost and troubled spirit condemned to wander the lonely roads forever. Teenagers like Rachael can be obsessive, angry, and unreasonable, and they'll fall in love in a heartbeat. Being dead doesn't make any difference. Darren and Jean Madden should never have opened the car doors that night when their station wagon mysteriously broke down. Jean has always known her attractive husband would be a hard man to keep. Rachael won't take no for an answer. Even ghosts won't wait forever. </p>";
