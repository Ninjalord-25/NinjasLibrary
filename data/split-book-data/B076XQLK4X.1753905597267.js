window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Stopping a tornado was the first of many strange events that seem to follow Weylyn from town to town, although he doesn't like to take credit. As amazing as these powers may appear, they tend to manifest themselves at inopportune times and places. From freak storms to trees that appear to grow over night, Weylyn's unique abilities are a curiosity at best and at worst, a danger to himself and the woman he loves. But Mary doesn't care. Since Weylyn saved her from an angry wolf on her 11th birthday, she's known that a relationship with him isn't without its risks, but as anyone who's met Weylyn will tell you, once he wanders into your life, you'll wish he'd never leave. </p> <p><i>Beasts of Extraordinary Circumstance</i> tells the story of Weylyn Grey's life from the perspectives of the people who knew him, loved him, and even a few who thought he was just plain weird. Although he doesn't stay in any of their lives for long, he leaves each of them with a story to tell. Stories about a boy who lives with wolves, great storms that evaporate into thin air, fireflies that make phosphorescent honey, and a house filled with spider webs and the strange man who inhabits it. </p>";
