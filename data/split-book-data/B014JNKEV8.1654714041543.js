In order to save the spa's reputation, Liz, along with her two dogs, Brandy Boy and Winston, sets out to find the killer. </p> <p>The cast of characters includes a handyman, spa employees, the bumbling police chief, the owner of Gertie's Diner, the dead woman's husband (the mayor) and his girlfriend, and a Tiffany glass collector. One of them probably committed the crime, but it's up to Liz to quickly find the culprit. </p> <p>Dianne is the author of two best-selling series: the <i>Cedar Bay Cozy Mystery Series</i> and the <i>Coyote Series</i>. </p>";
