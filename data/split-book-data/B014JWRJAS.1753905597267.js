Where the Great Quake of 1868 has shattered California into a labyrinth of sea-flooded caverns...and a mysterious substance called \"ghost rock\" fuels exotic steampunk inventions as well as plenty of bloodshed and flying bullets. In <i>Ghostwalkers</i>, a gun for hire, literally haunted by his bloody past, comes to the struggling town of Paradise Falls, where he becomes embroiled in a deadly conflict between the besieged community and a diabolically brilliant alchemist who is building terrible new weapons of mass destruction...and an army of the living dead! <i>Deadlands</i> is one of the most popular RPGs in history, with over a million <i>Deadlands</i> gaming books sold. </p>";
