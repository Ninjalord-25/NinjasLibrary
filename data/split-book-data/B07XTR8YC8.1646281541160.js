window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>He’s a good man having a bad day with the worst hangover. </b></p> <p>All Bunny McGarry wants is a spot of breakfast and a decent cup of tea. So imagine how annoyed he gets when two masked men attempt to rob the New York diner he is in. Unfortunately, dealing with that problem just leads to a whole lot more. One of the diner’s other customers isn’t who she appears to be, and the odds aren’t great that she is going to live to see another breakfast.&nbsp;</p> <p>So just how much trouble is she in?&nbsp;</p> <p>Well, you know how they’re always telling us to pay attention to our pensions? Some ex-employees of the US government are really taking that advice to heart by using their mayhem-creating abilities to maximise their investments. When one of their fund managers has a momentary crisis of conscience and confesses all to a woman he hardly knows, they will stop at nothing to deal with the problem. Amy Daniels is in big trouble and the only thing keeping her alive is a man who is supposed to already be dead.</p> <p>Disaster Inc., is the first book in a new series featuring Bunny McGarry, beloved by those who enjoyed the critically-acclaimed Dublin Trilogy of books. It melds high-octane action with a distinctly Irish acerbic wit.</p>";
