window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I am bound to the dark...and the dark is bound to me.&nbsp;</p> <p>No one can know what I am. But this secret I carry, it isn't an easy one to hide. It burns within me. It changes me each and every day, making the line between me and the ghosts I love smaller and smaller.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet, no secret can remain hidden forever.</p> <p>The day my brother died changes everything. I'm commanded to attend the Royal Fae Academy, a place that wouldn't welcome someone like me. But as much as I fear what will happen next, I have to find my brother's killer. No matter the cost.&nbsp;</p> <p>Danger haunts my every step. Someone here wants me dead. And my brother's three best friends are determined to protect me from my enemies. Only they have no idea what I am. Or what I'm capable of doing.&nbsp;</p> <p>And even though I care for them, and I feel they care for me, I have to keep them away.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because the dark is where I belong. But these men? They belong in the light.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even if they don't know it yet.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Ravage </i>is the first full book in a steamy reverse-harem romance series, although there is a short prequel before it titled <i>Revere</i>. These books have a spooky edge, hot scenes, and a mystery to unravel.&nbsp;</p> <p>So, if you love paranormal romances with tough heroines and protective men, you may want to get the audiobook now!</p>";
