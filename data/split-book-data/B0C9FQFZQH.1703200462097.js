With nothing to lose, she accepts.</p><p>The young knight finds herself invited into a magical dungeon that can appear anywhere at any time, where the patrons are served meals hunted by their own hand. Revived by the meal made from her own hunt, Fortuna learns the rules of this place and joins hands with other patrons from across the continent for the sake of food.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the real world, the young knight must grapple with those who pushed her to the brink and the family name she had run from for so long.</p><p><i>Hungry Dungeon&nbsp;</i>takes place in the same world as&nbsp;Bio Dungeon&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Slime Dungeon&nbsp;and can be enjoyed without having listened to the other series.
