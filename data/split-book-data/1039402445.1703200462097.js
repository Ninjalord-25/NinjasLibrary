window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A brutal war against a vast empire. An immortal mage. Soul-drinking daemons. A trickster god with chaos in mind. And a girl with the future of the world in her hands. </b><b><i>The Forever King</i></b><b> is the start of an epic, blood-soaked fantasy saga.</b></p> <p>In Emaneska, to consort with magick is to court death. Banned by the Arka Empire, magick's purging has finally brought peace to war-torn Emaneska.</p> <p>Like any dutiful citizen, Mithrid Fenn wants nothing to do with magick. But when an illegal spellbook washes up on a beach after a battle between giant, unknown ships, Mithrid Fenn is thrust into a war she never knew existed. Her family slaughtered,&nbsp;Mithrid finds herself&nbsp;hunted by daemons and the emperor's assassins. She is dragged inexorably north to Scalussen, where mages, dragons, beast-people, and witches doggedly wage a war for freedom against the tyrannical empire. But&nbsp;Mithrid only cares for revenge and nothing nobler. If killing the emperor means helping the Outlaw King, then so be it.&nbsp;Even if it means drowning the world in fire.</p>";
