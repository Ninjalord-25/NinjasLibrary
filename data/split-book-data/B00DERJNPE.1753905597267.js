As a longtime meth addict, he's no stranger to horrifying, drug-fueled hallucinations. </p> <p>But as he and his fellow junkies soon discover, the little girl is no illusion. The end of the world really has arrived. </p> <p>The funny thing is, Chase's life was over long before the apocalypse got here, his existence already reduced to a stinking basement apartment and a filthy mattress and an endless grind of buying and selling and using. He's lied and cheated and stolen and broken his parents' hearts a thousand times. And he threw away his only shot at sobriety a long time ago, when he chose the embrace of the drug over the woman he still loves. </p> <p>And if your life's already shattered beyond any normal hopes of redemptionâ€¦ well, maybe the end of the world is an <i>opportunity</i>. Maybe it's a last chance for Chase to hit restart and become the man he once dreamed of being. Soon he's fighting to reconnect with his lost love and dreaming of becoming her hero among civilization's ruins. </p> <p>But is salvation just another pipe dream? </p> <p>Propelled by a blistering first-person voice and featuring a powerfully compelling antihero, <i>Fiend</i> is at once a riveting portrait of addiction, a pitch-black love story, and a meditation on hope, redemption, and delusion - not to mention one hell of a zombie novel.</p>";
