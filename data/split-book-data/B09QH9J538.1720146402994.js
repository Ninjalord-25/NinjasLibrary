window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Always the Dungeon Master, never the player. </b></p> <p>Juniper Smith was always a creator of worlds rather than the one who walked within them…until now.</p> <p>Somehow, the tables have turned in the most dramatic way possible. Juniper finds himself in a world filled with the wildest fantasies a mind could come up with, and his fingerprints are all over it.</p> <p>Throughout this world, echoes of his own ideas and plots leave him feeling like he’s always one step behind. He finds bits and pieces of ancient influence strewn about every town he goes through. One thing is clear, though: Juniper walks this magical new world in someone else’s shadow.</p> <p>It might all add up to something vital...if only he can survive long enough to figure it out.</p> <p><b>This top-rated Royal Road-hit with over 3 million views is now brought to you in professionally formatted audio available exclusively on Audible.</b></p>";
