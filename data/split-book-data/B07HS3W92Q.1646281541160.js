window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Chicago is gripped by terror. The Sweet 16 Killer is brutally murdering young women, and the authorities are baffled.</p> <p>When the police are called to an affluent home in the middle of the night, they learn a seemingly normal 14-year-old boy has attacked his family. The boy exhibits signs of demonic possession, and even more troublingly, he knows too much about the Sweet 16 killings. Father Jason Crowder, a young priest assigned to the case, must marshal his courage in order to save the boy and the entire city from the forces of evil.</p> <p>But this is a darkness mankind has never encountered before. It craves more than blood. And it won’t rest until it possesses Father Crowder’s soul.</p> <p>Jonathan Janz’s brand-new release brings the original novella that started it all - <i>Exorcist Road</i> - and a brand-new full-length novel (<i>Exorcist Falls</i>) together for a shattering experience in supernatural terror.</p>";
