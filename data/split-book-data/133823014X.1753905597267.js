Those who dream cannot stop dreaming - they can only try to control it. Those who are dreamed cannot have their own lives - they will sleep forever if their dreamers die. </i></p> <p><i>And then there are those who are drawn to the dreamers. To use them. To trap them. To kill them before their dreams destroy us all. </i></p> <p>Ronan Lynch is a dreamer. He can pull both curiosities and catastrophes out of his dreams and into his compromised reality. </p> <p>Jordan Hennessy is a thief. The closer she comes to the dream object she is after, the more inextricably she becomes tied to it. </p> <p>Carmen Farooq-Lane is a hunter. Her brother was a dreamer...and a killer. She has seen what dreaming can do to a person. And she has seen the damage that dreamers can dor. But that is nothing compared to the destruction that is about to be unleashed....</p>";
