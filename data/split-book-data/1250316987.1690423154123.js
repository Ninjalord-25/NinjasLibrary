window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Reese's Book Club x Hello Sunshine on Audible Pick</b></p> <p>\"You won’t be able to put this down! I’m excited to announce that our April pick is <i>The Night Tiger</i> by Yangsze Choo. Set in a tiny Malaysian town in the 1930s, the story is about a mystifying tiger who haunts the villages, followed by a series of mysterious deaths. The two main characters will captivate you as their paths are destined to cross. I can’t wait to hear what you think!\" (Reese Witherspoon)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Choo narrates this richly complex novel herself, her gorgeous writing delivered in a voice that is deep and precise and lovely, both British and not quite. Her tone and words transport us....\" (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p><i>This program is read by the author.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><b>A sweeping historical audiobook about a dance hall girl and an orphan boy whose fates entangle over an old Chinese superstition about men who turn into tigers. </b></p> <p>Quick-witted, ambitious Ji Lin is stuck as an apprentice dressmaker, moonlighting as a dance hall girl to help pay off her mother’s Mahjong debts. But when one of her dance partners accidentally leaves behind a gruesome souvenir, Ji Lin may finally get the adventure she has been longing for.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eleven-year-old houseboy Ren is also on a mission, racing to fulfill his former master’s dying wish: that Ren find the man’s finger, lost years ago in an accident, and bury it with his body. Ren has 49 days to do so, or his master’s soul will wander the earth forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the days tick relentlessly by, a series of unexplained deaths wracks the district, along with whispers of men who turn into tigers. Ji Lin and Ren’s increasingly dangerous paths crisscross through lush plantations, hospital storage rooms, and ghostly dreamscapes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yangsze Choo's <i>The Night Tiger</i> pulls us into a world of servants and masters, age-old superstition and modern idealism, sibling rivalry and forbidden love. But anchoring this dazzling, propulsive audiobook is the intimate coming of age of a child and a young woman, each searching for their place in a society that would rather they stay invisible.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Amazon.com Best Books of the Year - 2019</b></p>";
