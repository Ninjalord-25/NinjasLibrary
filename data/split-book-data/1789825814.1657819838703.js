window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In writing <i>Dracula</i>, Bram Stoker created a universe full of rich characters, dark and foreboding locations, and a tangled web of loyalties, relationships and motivations. Despite the story being fictional - at least one hopes that’s the case - many elements within the story were reflections and analogies of the Stoker family and their history.</p> <p>A little over 120 years after the book’s original release, Bram’s great-grandnephew Dacre Stoker has teamed up with author Chris McAuley to create a series of short stories set within the StokerVerse, each narrated from the point of view of one of the characters we all know - or think we know - so well.</p> <p>Narrated by some of the leading voice actors of today, Stoker’s short stories are dark, twisted and of course hugely entertaining. Simon Templeman (<i>Legacy of Kain</i>, <i>Dragon Age</i>, <i>Dead Space 3</i>, <i>Charmed </i>and so much more) plays Dracula, with all the expertise and finesse one would expect from such a lauded performer, whilst Claudia Christian (<i>Babylon 5</i>, <i>9-1-1</i>, Disney’s <i>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i>) is the mysterious Thief. TV’s sixth Doctor, Colin Baker (<i>Doctor Who</i>, <i>Kingdom</i>, <i>Hustle</i>), masterfully narrates vampire hunter Van Helsing’s stories, whilst Terry Molloy - most famous for playing the Doctor’s on-screen nemesis Davros - takes the part of Renfield. Jessica Martin (<i>Doctor Who</i>, <i>The Sandman</i>) completes the line-up as Mina Harker.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of vampires - particularly those of a more gothic nature - then these brand-new adventures will surely appeal to you. With Dacre Stoker’s major contribution, these stories are the most significant addition to the official Dracula canon since Francis Ford Coppola’s 1992 film <i>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</i>.</p>";
