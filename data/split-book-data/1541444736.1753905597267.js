Following a five-year exile, I'm back in my childhood bedroom. Only, this time, there are silver bars on all the windows and vault locks on the doors.</p> <p>In lieu of a homecoming party, my father is hosting a barbaric tournament to determine who will win my hand in marriage. And really, who wouldn't want to spend the rest of their limitless days with a blood-thirsty vampire fresh from a cage match? This is what dreams are made of, ladies!</p> <p>Things go from bad to train wreck when my only ally gets herself kidnapped and I'm left with one of my would-be boyfriends after someone loses their head - I wish I was kidding - in my bedroom. I have to save my friend, watch my back, and keep my heart from chasing after my temporary partner in crime, all without landing in the crosshairs of whatever monster is terrorizing the Eastern Court.</p>";
