For Annalise, Younish Camp - the only home she’s ever known - has turned into a factioned nightmare. Her brother, Paul, had always been a little off, but now things have spiraled. With the oppression of the scrawn and breeders at an all-time high, and the pure lumberjacks now severing limbs in favor of mechanical appendages, camp has become extremely dangerous. Who wants to live with a bunch of men with saws for arms anyway?</p> <p>Annalise has two choices: conform to the lumberchief’s will or escape. But Annalise has a secret. One that could cost her life.

No one has ever survived an encounter with a keringer. One false move in her plan and Annalise will not only die, but also bring down her good friend and anyone else who follows.</p> <p>The weight of the world is on her shoulders.</p> <p>But that’s just another day in lumberjacking, right?</p>";
