window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Being a lumberjack isn’t easy - especially when your brother is trying to kill you. For Annalise, Younish Camp - the only home she’s ever known - has turned into a factioned nightmare. Her brother, Paul, had always been a little off, but now things have spiraled. With the oppression of the scrawn and breeders at an all-time high, and the pure lumberjacks now severing limbs in favor of mechanical appendages, camp has become extremely dangerous. Who wants to live with a bunch of men with saws for arms anyway?</p> <p>Annalise has two choices: conform to the lumberchief’s will or escape. But Annalise has a secret. One that could cost her life. Using spontaneity and her reckless resolve, she tries to formulate a plan with her good friend Marshall. But as it takes form, she wonders if it will be enough to safely escape. Not only will she have to figure out how to get to a camp more than a hundred miles away, but she also has the threat of the dreaded keringer - a relentless beast that roams and hunts in the timber. No one has ever survived an encounter with a keringer. One false move in her plan and Annalise will not only die, but also bring down her good friend and anyone else who follows.</p> <p>The weight of the world is on her shoulders.</p> <p>But that’s just another day in lumberjacking, right?</p>";
