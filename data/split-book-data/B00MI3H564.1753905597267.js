window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Victor Bayne, the psychic half a PsyCop team, is a gay medium who's more concerned with flying under the radar than in making waves. </p> <p>He hooks up with handsome Jacob Marks, a non-psychic (or \"Stiff\") from an adjacent precinct at his ex-partner's retirement party, and it seems like his dubious luck has taken a turn for the better. But then a serial killer surfaces who can change his appearance to match any witness' idea of the world's hottest guy. </p> <p>Solving murders is a snap when you can ask the victims whodunit, but this killer's not leaving any spirits behind. </p> <p>Warning: This audiobook contains explicit adult content.</p>";
