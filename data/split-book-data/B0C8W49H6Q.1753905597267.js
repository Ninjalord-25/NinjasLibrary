Just the way I liked it.</p> <p>That’s what 23 years in the magical backwater of Vancouver will get you—a completely skewed sense of reality. Because when the dead werewolves started showing up, it all unraveled—except for the cupcake part. That’s a universal truth.</p> <p><i>Cupcakes, Trinkets, and Other Deadly Magic</i> is the first book in the Dowser series, which is set in the same universe as the Oracle, Reconstructionist, Amplifier, Archivist, and Misfits of the Adept Universe series. While it is not necessary to listen to the whole series, in order to avoid spoilers, the ideal listening order of the Adept Universe begins with C<i>upcakes, Trinkets, and Other Deadly Magic.</i></p>";
