But everything changes when he becomes a fallen angel and is charged with saving the souls of seven people from the seven deadly sins.</p> <p>Vin diPietro long ago sold his soul to his business, and he's good with that - until fate intervenes in the form of a tough-talking Harley-riding, self-professed savior. But then he meets a woman who will make him question his destiny, his sanity, and his heart - and he has to work with a fallen angel to win her over and redeem his own soul.</p>";
