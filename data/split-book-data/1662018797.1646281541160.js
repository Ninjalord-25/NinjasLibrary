window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Once upon a time, Aveda Jupiter (aka Annie Chang) was demon-infested San Francisco’s most beloved superheroine, a beacon of hope and strength and really awesome outfits. But all that changed the day she agreed to share the spotlight with her best friend and former assistant Evie Tanaka - who’s now a badass fire-wielding superheroine in her own right. They were supposed to be a dynamic duo, but more and more, Aveda finds herself shoved into the sidekick role, which is not at all comfortable.&nbsp;</p> <p>It doesn’t help that Aveda’s finally being forced to deal with the fallout from her diva behavior and the fact that she’s been a less than stellar friend to Evie, that she’s suddenly getting the cold shoulder from the man she’s loved for nearly a decade, or that the city has been demon-free for three months in the wake of Evie and Aveda’s apocalypse-preventing battle, leaving her without the one thing she craves most in life: a mission.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of this is causing Aveda’s burning sense of heroic purpose - the thing that’s guided her all these years - to falter.&nbsp;</p> <p>In short, Aveda Jupiter is having an identity crisis.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Evie gets engaged and drafts Aveda as her maid-of-honor, Aveda finally sees a chance to reclaim her sense of self and sets out on a single-minded mission to make sure Evie has the most epic wedding ever. But when a mysterious unseen supernatural evil rises up and starts attacking brides-to-be, Aveda must summon both her superheroine and best friend mojo to take down the enemy and make sure Evie’s wedding goes off without a hitch - or see both her city and her most important friendship destroyed forever.</p>";
