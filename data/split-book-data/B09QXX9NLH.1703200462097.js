window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kinda dead. Straight-up psycho. Totally obsessed with her.</p> <p>I did a bad, bad thing.</p> <p>Thanks to a blank in my memory, I'm not sure what that thing was, but it was horrible enough to get me locked up in the mental ward for seven years. Horrible enough that my little sister won't even speak to me.</p> <p>But when I'm released back into a town determined to rub my unknown sins in my face, the past isn't the only thing that's haunting me. The four \"imaginary\" friends who made my childhood bearable barge into my life in a very real way.</p> <p>They're crude, criminally inclined, and more than a little unstable after ages trapped in afterlife limbo. All they want is to protect me. Worship me. Avenge me.</p> <p>So they'll bludgeon, maim, eviscerate - tear a strip of havoc right through this sleepy town.</p> <p>Even rise from the dead.</p> <p>Maybe I'm still not all that sane either, because part of me finds them strangely appealing. In ways very different from how I felt as a kid. And that's not the only strangeness stirring inside me...</p> <p>I promised myself I'd stick to the straight and narrow from here on. But what if the only way to set things right is to get a little ghoulish?</p> <p>Note: <i>The Stalking Dead</i> is the first in a darkly humorous new paranormal romance series by best-selling author Eva Chase. If you love sarcastic heroines with unexpected powers, obsessive supernatural men who'll do anything to defend their woman, and plenty of mystery and mayhem, dive right in!</p>";
