And—as if that wasn’t enough—two wannabe gods whose meddling only makes things worse.</b></p> <p>Plagued by the evil wizard Lorem Ipsum, the fate of Bitworld rests in the hands of one boy.</p> <p>Except, that boy didn’t exactly come out of his tutorial a proper hero...</p> <p>Instead of an established hero class, Grey exited the tutorial a misnomer. An error...</p> <p>An urgent message reveals that Grey’s mother has been kidnapped by a glitch dragon, sweeping him up into a whirlwind of epic adventure. In order to save her—and Bitworld—the misnomer must solve puzzles, level up, conquer legions of monsters lurking in the mountains, and confront his worst fears.</p> <p>“Only once in a great while does a writer come along who defies convention—a writer so original he challenges the way we view our realities. Logan Atlas might just be such a writer, and Dawn of the Misnomer is such a tale; a coming-of-age hero’s journey, flipped on its head in a way that feels fresh and exciting. Weaving consciousness redefinings, boss battles, and everything in between for a trope-twisting, inspiring, and, most of all, a fun adventure, this story is the young adult LitRPG we didn’t know we needed. <i>Bitworld </i>is what you’d expect to find if Terry Pratchett, David Eddings, and Neil Gaiman joined forces to create a simulated epic fantasy world—appropriate for all (literate) ages.” (Craig Kobayashi, author of LitRPG novel <i>The Culling of Man</i>)</p>";
