window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After barely surviving an onslaught of elves and Templars and assorted monsters—not to mention the devilish machinations of an old god—Gabe and his friends <i>had </i>hoped for some time to recover. But when an overwhelming threat shows up on their doorstep far ahead of schedule, they quickly discover that <i>time</i> is yet one more force stacked against them. Along with practically everything else.</p> <p>So together with old friends and new, Gabe searches desperately for more allies to form an unprecedented coalition to stand against the coming End—all the while being careful not to mention that it’s at least partially his fault.</p> <p>But even Gabe’s rock-bottom expectations are thwarted when the shaky path he envisions for their future suddenly crumbles beneath him, and he’s taken on a wild ride far from home...straight into the grasping claws of his own nightmares.</p> <p><i>Dawn Razed</i> is the fourth book in the Ethereal Earth series, an ongoing saga about identity and imagination...and how dangerous it is to have one without the other.</p>";
