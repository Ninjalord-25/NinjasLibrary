When a new mage is discovered, Royal Society elites descend like buzzards to snatch up a new apprentice. Talented mages are bought from their families at a tremendous price, while weak mages are snapped up for a pittance.

His sister Charlotte is, and to prevent her brother from being imprisoned for false reporting she combines her powers with his to make him seem a better prospect. </p> <p>When she discovers a nefarious plot by the sinister Doctor Ledbetter, Charlotte must use all her cunning and guile to protect her family, her secret and her city.</p> <p><i>Brother's Ruin</i> is the first in a new gaslamp fantasy series by Emma Newman.</p> <p>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>";
