No one warned Linda that something dreadful was listening, waiting for the chance, feeding off her grief, when she unwittingly wished aloud that her husband Brian was still alive. She never meant that he should escape his grave. Now, to put things right, Linda has to play a frightening game with the mysterious, disturbing undertaker, James Bracken. The rules are impossible, horrifying. It's a good thing Linda didn't throw away Brian's favorite chair. He still likes to sit there, watching the blank television. </p>";
