Listen and find out.</p> <p>I never really expected to go from full-time Neet to a God, but you know how life hits, right? Well, it doesn't really matter in the end. What matters is how I got there. You know how I said this ain't that type of guide? Well, maybe it can be. Maybe you'll figure some things out along the wayâ€”who knows? Actually I do, and you probably won't, but who cares, right? So take a seat in your mother's basement ,or whatever hole you live in, and listen to the story of how I, a full-time Neet, became a God.</p>";
