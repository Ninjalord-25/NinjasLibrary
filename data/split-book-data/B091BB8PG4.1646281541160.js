window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Traces of Magic</i> explores the pre-history of Kentucky, a land strangely uninhabited when Europeans came across the Appalachian Mountains, in ways parallel to how epic tales like the Lord of the Rings series unlocked the imagination of the British Isles residents to their pre-history. The story follows the struggles of a group of young adults who get caught up in defending the wonders of their land against an assassinsâ€™ guild bent on power and profit regardless of the cost. Knights and bards, clergy and users of magic, as well as many ordinary, good people, all help defend against the diabolic powers working with that guild to enslave the valley by controlling the weather.</p>";
