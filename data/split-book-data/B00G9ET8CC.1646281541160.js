window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Mira Grant comes a vision of a decade in the future, where humanity thrives in the absence of sickness and disease.</p> <p>We owe our good health to a humble parasite - a genetically engineered tapeworm developed by the pioneering SymboGen Corporation. When implanted, the Intestinal Bodyguard worm protects us from illness, boosts our immune system - even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost every human being has a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.</p> <p>But these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives...and will do anything to get them.</p> <p>More from Mira Grant:</p> <p><b>Parasitology</b></p> <ul> <li><i>Parasite</i></li> <li><i>Symbiont</i></li> <li><i>Chimera</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><b>Newsflesh</b></p> <ul> <li><i>Feed</i></li> <li><i>Deadline</i></li> <li><i>Blackout</i></li> <li><i>Feedback</i></li> <li><i>Rise</i></li> </ul>";
