window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the zombie apocalypse hits the quiet Asheville, NC, subdivision of Whispering Pines, the residents don't turn to the police or the military. Nope. They rely on their iron-fisted Home Owners Association! Which Jace Stanford and his family aren’t too keen on. Undead hordes are hard enough to deal with in a post-apocalyptic hellscape, who needs HOA fines, too?</p> <p>Filled with blood, gore, plenty of bad jokes, cannibals, dreaded HOA covenants, and a whole lot of snark, <i>Z-Burbia</i> is guaranteed to thrill and entertain!</p> <p>Welcome to life in Z-Burbia!</p> <p>“For those still not convinced about the zombie genre, <i>Z-Burbia</i> is worth a read if only for its female characters: Jake Bible doesn’t have time for vapid whimpering damsels in distress. Oh no. Bible’s characters are thinking, acting, feisty sorts.” (Lee Murray, Bram Stoker Award-winning novelist)</p>";
