window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the instant <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Swamplandia!</i> (a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize), a dazzling new collection of stories that showcases Karen Russell's gifts at their inimitable best.</b> </p> <p>In the collection's marvelous title story, two aging vampires in a sun-drenched Italian lemon grove find their hundred-year marriage tested when one of them develops a fear of flying. In \"The Seagull Army Descends on Strong Beach, 1979\", a dejected teenager discovers that the universe is communicating with him through talismanic objects left in a seagull's nest. \"Proving Up\" and \"The Graveless Doll of Eric Mutis\" - stories of children left to fend for themselves in dire predicaments - find Russell veering into more sinister territory, and ultimately crossing the line into full-scale horror. In \"The New Veterans\", a massage therapist working with a tattooed war veteran discovers she has the power to heal by manipulating the images on his body. In all, these wondrous new pieces display a young writer of superlative originality and invention coming into the full range and scale of her powers. </p>";
