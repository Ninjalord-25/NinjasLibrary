I’ll be both referring to and recommending this book on a daily basis for many years to come.” (Amy Cuddy)</b></p> <p>Joe Navarro has spent a lifetime observing others. For 25 years, as a special agent for the FBI, he conducted and supervised interrogations of spies and other dangerous criminals, honing his mastery of nonverbal communication. After retiring from the bureau, he has become a sought-after public speaker and consultant and an internationally best-selling author. Now, a decade after his groundbreaking book&nbsp;<i>What Every BODY is Saying</i>, Navarro returns with his most ambitious work yet.&nbsp;<i>The Dictionary of Body Language</i> is a pioneering “field guide” to nonverbal communication, describing and explaining the more than 400 behaviors that will allow you to gauge anyone’s true intentions.</p> <p>Moving from the head down to the feet, Navarro reveals the hidden meanings behind the many conscious and subconscious things we do. Listeners will learn how to tell a person’s actual feelings from subtle changes in their pupils; the lip behaviors that betray concerns or hidden information; the many different varieties of arm posturing, and what each one means; how the position of our thumbs when we stand akimbo reflects our mental state; and many other fascinating insights to help you both read others and change their perceptions of you.</p> <p>Listeners&nbsp;will turn to <i>The Dictionary Body Language</i> again and again - a body-language bible for anyone looking to understand what their boss really means, interpret whether a potential romantic partner is interested or not, and learn how to put themselves forward in the most favorable light.</p> <p>*GlobalGurus.org</p>";
