Luckily, two hot girls from his class have the same idea: Attend the university’s game club to get reaction material for their papers.</p> <p>A creepy game moderator shows up, ready to start a game of Monsters, Maces and Magic. Glenn doesn’t fret over the GM’s disturbing vibe, figuring it’ll lead to potential fodder for his paper.</p> <p>Moments after rolling up his character and beginning the adventure, Glenn, his two classmates, and three other players are drawn into the game - literally. How and why they got trapped in the game, transformed into their RPG characters are important questions, sure. But simply surviving a world filled with horrific creatures, unknown magic, and perilous roads is first on the list. </p>";
