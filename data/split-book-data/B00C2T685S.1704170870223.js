window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Bared to You</i> </b></p> <p>Years ago, Evangeline Hollis spent a blistering night with a darkly seductive man she can’t forget. But that evening of addictive pleasure has become a disaster of biblical proportions: She’s been branded with the Mark of Cain. Now Eve is thrust into a world where sinners are marked and drafted to kill demons. Her former one-night stand, Cain, is now her mentor - and his equally sexy brother Abel is her new boss. And Eve has become the latest point of contention in the oldest case of sibling rivalry in history.... Cursed by God, hunted by demons, desired by Cain and Abel...all in a day's work.</p>";
