window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With the energy, wit, and singularity of vision that have earned him a reputation as a celebrated and charismatic musician, <i>The Vine That Ate the South</i> announces J.D. Wilkes as an accomplished storyteller on a surreal, Homeric voyage that strikes at the very heart of American mythology. </p> <p>In a forgotten corner of western Kentucky lies a haunted forest referred to locally as \"The Deadening\", where vampire cults roam wild and time is immaterial. Our protagonist and his accomplice - the one and only Carver Canute - set out down the Old Spur Line in search of the legendary Kudzu House, where an old couple is purported to have been swallowed whole by a hungry vine. Their quest leads them face to face with albino panthers, Great Dane-riding girls, protective property owners, and just about every American folk-demon ever, while forcing the protagonist to finally take stock of his relationship with his father and the man's mysterious disappearance. <i>The Vine That Ate the South</i> is a mesmerizing fantasia where Wilkes ambitiously grapples with the contradictions of the contemporary American South while subversively considering how well we know our own family and friends. </p>";
