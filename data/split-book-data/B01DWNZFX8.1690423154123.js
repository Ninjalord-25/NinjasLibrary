window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In an astonishing feat of empathy and narrative invention, our most ambitious novelist imagines an alternate version of American history. </p> <p>In 1940 Charles A. Lindbergh, heroic aviator and rabid isolationist, is elected president. Shortly thereafter, he negotiates a cordial \"understanding\" with Adolf Hitler while the new government embarks on a program of folksy anti-Semitism. For one boy growing up in Newark, Lindbergh's election is the first in a series of ruptures that threaten to destroy his small, safe corner of America - and with it his mother, his father, and his older brother. </p>";
