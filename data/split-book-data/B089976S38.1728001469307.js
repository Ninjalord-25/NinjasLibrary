Destined for Valhalla.</b></p> <p>In my dreams, Odin whispers to me.<br> He tells me I'm destined to wield a legendary sword.<br> He tells me my road will bring me to Valhalla.</p> <p>But when I wake, I'm only Hervor. Fatherless. Unloved. Unwanted. Jarl Bjartmar, my grandfather, calls me cursed. My mother, her memories stolen by the gods, has forgotten me. Everyone tells me I should have been left to the wolves, but no one will tell me why.</p> <p>None but Eydis, a thrall with völva magic, believes I'm meant for a greater destiny. Yet who can believe a devotee of Loki?</p> <p>When the king and his son arrive for the holy blót, the runes begin to fall in my favor. A way forward may lie in the handsome Viking set on winning my heart, but only if I unravel the mystery hanging over me first.</p> <p>Fans of <i>Vikings</i>,<i> The Last Kingdom</i>, and <i>The Mists of Avalon</i> will relish <i>Shield-Maiden: Under the Howling Moon</i>. This sweeping Viking Historical Fantasy retells the Norse Hervarar Saga, depicting the life of the shieldmaiden Hervor, the inspiration for J. R. R. Tolkien's Éowyn.</p>";
