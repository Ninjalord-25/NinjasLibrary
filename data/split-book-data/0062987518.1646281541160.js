window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A world split between day and night. Two sisters who must unite it. The author of </b><b><i>The Bone Witch</i></b><b> kicks off an epic YA fantasy duology perfect for fans of </b><b><i>Furyborn</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Generations of twin goddesses have long ruled Aeon - until one sisterâ€™s betrayal split their world in two. A Great Abyss now divides two realms: one cloaked in eternal night, the other scorched beneath an ever-burning sun.</p> <p>While one sister rules the frozen fortress of Aranth, her twin rules the sand-locked Golden City - each with a daughter by their side. Now those young goddesses must set out on separate, equally dangerous journeys in hopes of healing their broken world. No matter the sacrifice it demands.</p> <p><b>Told from four interweaving perspectives, this sweeping epic fantasy packs elemental magic, star-crossed romance, and incredible landscapes into a spectacular adventure with the fierce sisterhood of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Frozen&nbsp;</i></b><b>and the breakneck action of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
