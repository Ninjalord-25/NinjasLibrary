window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>SEAL Team Six meets Stephen King in this novel about an elite group of soldiers who protect the United States from supernatural threats. </p> <p>Halfway through SEAL training, Cadet Jack Walker, still green but showing incredible promise, is whisked away to join four SEALs and their dog for a special-ops mission. Walker soon finds himself in a whirlwind of otherworldly creatures and events as he discovers the true nature of SEAL Team 666. Battling demons, possessed humans, mass-murdering cults, and evil in its darkest and most and ancient form, the members of SEAL Team 666 have their work cut out for them. And it’s not long before they realize that the threat isn’t directed against the US alone - an ancient and deadly cult has far bigger plans, and Walker is at the center of a supernatural conflict in which the entire world is at stake. </p> <p>Weston Ochse won the Bram Stoker Award for his first novel, <i>Scarecrow Gods,</i> and was nominated for a Pushcart Prize for short fiction. He is a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer and currently works for the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p>";
