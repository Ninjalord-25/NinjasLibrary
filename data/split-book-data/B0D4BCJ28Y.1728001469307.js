He was on a one-way trip to the other place.<br> <br> Secondly, an angel literally pulled him from the brink of Hell and gave him a choice: Go straight to Hell, don't pass go, don't collect $200. Or, be put inside the body of an alternate version of himself on a completely different Earth where magic, not technology, rules, and get a chance to redeem his soul.<br> <br> The catch? (Isn't there always a catch?)<br> <br> To earn a place in the afterlife, Hunter must stop an immortal creature called the Nightlord before it can destroy the Free Lands.
