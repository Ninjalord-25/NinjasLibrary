window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I killed a girl last night. I did it with my bare hands and an old piece of pipe I found lying next to the dumpster. But that's not the part that got me. The part that scared me, the part I can't seem to wrap my head around and still has me reeling, was that when she charged me, her body shifted; and then she was a wolf - all snapping teeth and extended claws. But by the time I stood over her lifeless body, she was a girl again. That's about the time I went into shock. And that was the moment he showed up. </p> <p>Now, all I can do is accept the truths that are staring me in the face. One: werewolves do exist. And two: I was born to kill them. </p> <p>Fans of paranormal, hunters, shifters, and werewolves will love the Dirty Blood series! </p>";
