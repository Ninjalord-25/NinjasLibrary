window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This exclusive audiobook short story looks back - way back - to where it all began for Odd Thomas and Stormy Llewellyn, two souls who are destined to be together forever. </b></p> <p>Amid the dizzying rides, tantalizing games of chance, and fanciful attractions of a state fair, two teenage sweethearts on the cusp of life and love's pleasures find their way to a shadowy carnival tent brimming with curiosities. There, from the bizarre and enthralling Gypsy Mummy, a mechanized merchant of dreams and prognosticator of tomorrows, the young couple learns what fate promises for them. But fate, for Odd Thomas and Stormy Llewellyn, is something altogether different: full of dark corners, sharp edges, and things no seer or soothsayer could ever anticipate. </p> <p>And for Odd Thomas, a gallant fry cook from a sleepy California desert town, the future beckons - to listen to unquiet spirits, pursue unsettling mysteries, and learn shocking truths...for a purpose far greater than himself. </p>";
