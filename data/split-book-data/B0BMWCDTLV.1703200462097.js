So instead of going on a grand adventure to become a great and powerful wizard so he could save the world from certain destruction, Chauncy got a job.</p> <p>Twenty-five years later, destiny came for Chauncy a second time...and when <i>he</i> told it to take a hike, it knocked him out, tied him up, and kidnapped him.</p> <p>Now Chauncy has no choice but to go on the grand adventure he'd been putting off, to become a great and powerful wizard. Except he doesn't believe in magic, and he doesn't particularly believe in destiny either. Problem is, if he doesn't fulfill his destiny, the world as he knows it will end. And even if he <i>does</i> learn to become the wizard he should have been long ago, it might be too late anyway!</p> <p>Experience this (inappropriate) fantasy comedy from the author of the Runic series and the Magic of Havenwood series!</p> <p>DISCLAIMER:&nbsp;</p> <p>This book contains inappropriate depictions of inappropriate people doing inappropriate things.
