She certainly didn't expect to be a contender for the Fallen Queen's throne, a target for the Druid King's mafia, or a suspect in the murder of Junior, the Devil's oldest hell spawn.</p> <p> In a last-ditch effort to save her life and get out of her deal with the Devil she sets out to solve Junior's murder only to be taken prisoner by the four most dangerous immortal hell spawn alive.</p> <p> Not to be outdone, the Pagan Queen Mab claims Claire for entering her realm uninvited. She has an old debt to settle with her brother, the Devil. Taking Claire from him after losing her years ago is just icing on the cake.</p> <p> Will Claire win her freedom and save herself from the Devil? Or will she be trapped by Mab forever?</p>";
