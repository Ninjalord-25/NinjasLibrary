window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meet the ultra-rational Dr Newton Barlow. Cool, cynical, scientific, he’s the last man you’d want to be a bridge between the living and the dead. But with his academic reputation in tatters, and nothing to lose but his few remaining marbles, the great skeptic is about to discover that the past that haunts him will be nothing compared to his ghost-ridden future.</p> <p>Thrust into a rollicking struggle between good and evil, can Dr Barlow forget everything he ever believed in to save this world...and the next?</p> <p><b>Thrilling, chilling, and utterly hilarious, </b><b><i>The Unhappy Medium </i></b><b>is a bone-dry British comedy in the great tradition of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett.</b></p>";
