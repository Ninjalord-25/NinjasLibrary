window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since her parents were killed, Vivienne has always felt ungrounded, shuffled through the foster care system. Just when liberation finally seems possible - days before her 18th birthday - Vivienne is hospitalized with symptoms no one can explain. The doctors may be puzzled, but Deacon, her mysterious new friend, claims she has an active Nevergene. His far-fetched diagnosis comes with a warning: She is about to become an involuntary test subject for Humanitarian Organization for Order and Knowledge - or H.O.O.K. </p> <p>Vivienne can either escape to Neverland’s Kensington Academy and learn to fly (Did he really just say fly?), or risk sticking around to become a human lab rat. But accepting a place among The P.A.N. means Vivienne must abandon her life and foster family to safeguard their secrets, and hide in Neverland’s shadows...forever.</p>";
