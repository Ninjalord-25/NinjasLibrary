window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Who better to repel a body-snatching alien invasion than a group of teenage horror nerds?</p> <p>Billy and Tom are best friends, but each knows that at the end of the school year they'll be moving in different directions. But why not go out with a bang and throw one last video night? They can invite some girls over, order a pizza, then maybe try and fight the alien infection that's taken hold over their suburban town.</p> <p>It's <i>The Breakfast Club</i> meets <i>The Night of the Creeps</i> in this slime-drenched '80s horror romp.</p> <p>\"Hit that first chapter. It’ll hook you, and the next time you look up, you’ll have swallowed the book. It’ll be nesting inside you like a seed, like an egg, like an invasion.\" -Stephen Graham Jones, author of <i>Mongrels</i></p> <p>\"The momentum keeps building. The stakes keep escalating. The monsters just keep getting worse and worse, the catastrophic mayhem more juicy and hopeless. Best of all, the writing moves like a greased torpedo, compulsively readable as it rockets through your brain.\" - <i>Fangoria</i></p> <p>\"If you put together the gore, action, monsters, and sense of excitement that made '80s horror movies so great, you'll only have about half of what makes Video Night a must-read tome for horror fans.\" - <i>Horrortalk</i></p>";
