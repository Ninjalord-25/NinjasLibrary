window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of the Commune series and </b><b><i>All Gifts Bestowed</i></b><b> comes this mind-bending new science fiction novel.</b></p> <p>As a high school sophomore, Aiden Kelly's biggest problems should be his failing grades, his abusive father, being a self-proclaimed loner, or getting pummeled by the football team. Instead, Aiden's number one dilemma is a guy named Tony, a senior who seems to know all sorts of things that should be impossible to know.</p> <p>Oh, and he may also be a sociopath. So, you know: No. Big. Deal.</p> <p>When Aiden crosses Tony's path in the vice-principal's office, they form a mysterious connection, and only Tony knows the truth about it. But as their friendship grows, the strings of destiny tying their lives together slowly begin to unravel with deadly consequences.</p> <p>Now, Aiden must decide which is worse: to return to his degenerate, loner existence, or experience the friendship of a lifetime - where one of them might not survive.</p> <p><b>With a heavy foot grounded in realism and characters that leap out of the audio, </b><b><i>Something No One Knows</i></b><b> is perfect for fans of </b><b><i>The OA</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Sense8</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>The Butterfly Effect</i></b><b>.</b></p>";
