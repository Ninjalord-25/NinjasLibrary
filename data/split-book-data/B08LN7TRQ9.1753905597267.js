At the same time, a member of the Montgomery clan from the Pennsylvania mountains also waited for a delayed flight. Little did either family know or suspect, the effects from this first meeting would last forever.</p> <p>Family is everything to the Alexanders and the Montgomerys.

As their lives play out and intertwine in surprising ways, they face a challenging future and marshal their forces to work for the better good of all.</p>";
