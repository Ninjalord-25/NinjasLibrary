window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Deep in the Norwegian Sea, an ancient underwater complex was discovered by a pair of scuba divers, Eirik and Jack. Once inside, they learned that the technology present within was too sophisticated and advanced to have been created in our time. A new United Nations organization was formed to determine its origin and potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>A diverse collection of highly specialized personnel - among them, Steven Mitchell, a computer hacker, and Chrissy O'Donnell, an engineer - are recruited to investigate the facility and crack the secret of the highly restrictive access control security system.&nbsp;</p> <p>The group's exploration yielded unimaginable wonders, but they have also unwittingly opened Pandora's Box, as unscrupulous individuals and entities have taken an interest in the potential offered by the structure. Unavoidably, a struggle between moralities versus profits and science versus religion ensues, threatening every member of the project and the world from discovering the greatest truth about our existence.</p>";
