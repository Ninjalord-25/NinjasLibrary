window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jackson Blackwell, the Shadow Master, is in trouble. And we’re not talking about that fake kind of trouble most books use to lure in listeners. This is the “oh crap, we’ve been reading about Sophia’s vengeance for three books now” kind of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s right, dear listener. You heard me correctly. The time has finally come for Sophia to enact her vengeance against one Julian Jackson Blackwell. The name of the book is Villains Defeat, after all, and it is a story of team building, betrayal, plots-within-plots, and a how-to guide for toppling an empire. So, yeah, we’re kind of riffing on “the heist” genre in this one.</p> <p>But what good is a heist story that doesn’t have the occasional twist?</p> <p><i>Villains Defeat</i> is the fourth installment in the multiple-award-nominated and one-win (SOVA 2019 baby!) Shadow Master series. This thrilling and hilarious adventure shines a spotlight on Jackson’s foibles and flaws as overlooked plot points of the past come back to bite him in a major way. Attacked on multiple fronts, and across multiple worlds, does the Shadow Master have what it takes to stay on top?&nbsp;</p> <p>Well...what’s the name of this book again?</p>";
