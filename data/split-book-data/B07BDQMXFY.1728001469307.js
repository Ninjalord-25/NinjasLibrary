window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"If you ever wondered how much better Sherlock would be if people could hurl hellfire at each other, well this one is for you.\" (<i>Starburst Magazine </i>on <i>A Study in Brimstone</i>)</p> <p>Warlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson find themselves inconvenienced by a variety of eldritch beings, and the fact that one of them has goat legs. Christmas brings a goose that doesn't let being cooked slow him down, then they meet an electricity demon and discover why being a redhead is even trickier than one might imagine, and Holmes attempts an Irish accent. And naturally Moriarty is hanging around in some form or other.</p>";
