Also, he's been asked to join the League—the very organization of superheroes that spurned his dad. Then theres the secret Thom can barely face himself: he's gay.</p> <p>But becoming a member of the League opens up a new world to Thom. There, he connects with a misfit group of aspiring heroes, including Scarlett, who can control fire but not her anger; Typhoid Larry, who can make anyone sick with his touch; and Ruth, a wise old broad who can see the future. Like Thom, these heroes have things to hide; but they will have to learn to trust one another when they uncover a deadly conspiracy within the League.</p> <p>To survive, Thom will face challenges he never imagined. To find happiness, he'll have to come to terms with his fathers past, and discover the kind of hero he really wants to be.</p> <p>Timely and inspiring,<i>Hero</i> tackles love, friendship, and the struggle to come to terms with who we really are in a sincere and suspenseful way.</p> <p>This audiobook includes an exclusive introduction written and read by Stan Lee himself.</p>";
