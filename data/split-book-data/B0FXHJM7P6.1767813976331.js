window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seth Willard is broke, sick, and running out of time.</p> <p>A single dad drowning under bills and a cancer diagnosis, his last chance comes from a desperate gamble: taking a job as an NPC in a real world, fully immersive zombie survival experience. The nanites injected into his body that will project the game’s experience into his senses will also cure his cancer as he safely sells supplies to rich players out killing monsters that aren’t really there.<br> <br> At least, that’s the plan. His sense of humor ain't getting it done, that's for sure.<br> <br> A glitch drops him into the streets of the game environment as a player instead, looted hatchet in hand, surrounded by the stench of decay and the teeth of the undead. The wounds, the hunger, the terror—it seems all too real. And if Seth dies here, he loses his job, the nanites shut down, and not long after…so does his real body.<br> <br> But death isn’t the only danger. The deeper Seth fights into this popular “game,” the clearer it becomes: this isn’t just a job, and it isn’t just a harmless simulation. Someone built this world for more purposes than entertainment—and it holds terrors darker than the digital zombies clawing through its ruins.<br> <br> Seth’s survival isn’t just about levelling up, gaining skills, and finding loot. It isn't about living another day in the game. It’s about uncovering the truth—and carving out a future for his sons and maybe a whole lot more people—before the glitch that should save him destroys him for good instead.<br> <br> Fans of Chris Philbrook's 16 book long <i>Adrian’s Undead Diary</i> will love this fast-paced, raunchy LitRPG/GameLit zombie adventure packed with action, gore, sarcasm, a whole lot of heart, and a terrifying twist.</p>";
