They dropped a bomb that reduced his home to waste, his family to dust, and left him broken with no hope for vengeance. Now he’s just a lone cyborg digging through scraps for his next meal.</p> <p>That changes when a rebel assassin stalks Slip, eager to unlock the untapped potential hidden deep within him—his unique connection to the A.I. in his head. With nothing left to lose, he accepts the invitation to duel for upgrades to his tech, created by the very ones who destroyed his life: the history-obsessed Sci-gods.</p> <p>Thrust into his new reality, Slip will be forced to choose an allegiance of old—Roman, Greek, Egyptian, or Norse—to fight in the arena for gifts bestowed by ancient deities and ascend from the futile depths of the fields to the glory of a hailed champion.</p> <p>Here begins the chase for retribution and the search for the power to slay gods.</p>";
