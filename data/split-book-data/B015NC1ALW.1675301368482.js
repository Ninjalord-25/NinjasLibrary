But his talents are viewed with suspicion in Cove, a steam-powered city built inside a mountain. In Cove, creativity is a crime, and <i>invention</i> is a curse word. </p> <p>Kallista Babbage is a repair technician and daughter of the notorious Leo Babbage, who died in an explosion - an event the leaders of Cove point to as an example of the danger of creativity. </p> <p>Working together, Trenton and Kallista learn that Leo Babbage was developing a secret project before he perished.
