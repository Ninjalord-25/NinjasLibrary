window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. </p> <p>The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. </p> <p>Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. </p> <p>After seeing her maybe-mobster boss murder a guy, Delaney James assumes a new identity and pretends to be a mail order bride. She finds her groom-to-be living in a town that celebrates Halloween every day. Weird. But not as weird as what she doesn't know. Her groom-to-be is a 400-year-old vampire. </p> <p>Hugh Ellingham has only agreed to the arranged setup to make his overbearing grandmother happy. In 30 days, whatever bridezilla shows up at his door will be escorted right back out. His past means love is no longer an option. Not if the woman's going to have a future. Except he never counted on Delaney and falling in love for real. </p> <p>Too bad both of them are keeping some mighty big secrets.... </p>";
