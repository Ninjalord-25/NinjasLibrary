After hiding for years, I've been found.</p> <p>A protection I've been relying on is gone. While my wolf traits are strengthening steadily, the loss also left my mind vulnerable to attack. Someone is ensnaring me in horrifying visions intended to kill. Clive, the sexy vampire Master of the City, has figured out how to pull me out, designating himself my personal bodyguard. He's grumpy about it, but that kiss is telling a different story. A change is taking place. It has to.</p> <p>I'm a survivor. I'll fight fang and claw to protect myself and the ones I love. And let's face it - they have it coming.</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
