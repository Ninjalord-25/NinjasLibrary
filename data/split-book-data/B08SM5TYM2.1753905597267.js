Only death.</p> <p>I’m an Earth Fae who doesn’t belong here. </p> <p>They can play their little mind games all they want, but I'm going to find a way back to my elemental world. Even if it kills me. </p> <p>Except, Headmaster Zephyrus is one step ahead of my every move. </p> <p>Prince Kolstov won’t stop cornering me. </p> <p>And Shadow - the reason I’m in this damn mess to begin with - haunts my dreams. </p> <p>My affinity for the earth is dying and being replaced by something more sinister. Something powerful. Something deadly.</p> <p>The Midnight Fae believe this is my fate. </p> <p>They claim that I was “recruited” for a purpose. </p> <p>To battle a rising presence. Or to die trying.</p> <p>I don’t owe them a damn thing. But if I have to pass their trials to find my way home, then so be it. I survived a plague and far worse in the Elemental Fae realm. An ominous energy? Please. What a joke.</p> <p>Give it your best shot. I’m waiting. </p> <p>And don’t you dare bite me. Or, I’ll make you regret it. </p> <p><b>Author's note: </b>This is a dark paranormal reverse harem trilogy with bully romance (enemies-to-lovers) elements. Despite Aflora’s opinions on the matter, there will definitely be biting. Shadow, a.k.a. Shade, guarantees it. This book ends on a cliff-hanger.</p>";
