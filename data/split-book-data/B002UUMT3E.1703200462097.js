window.bookSummaryJSON = "F. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, \"marks an advance over <i>This Side of Paradise</i>,\" Edmund Wilson wrote. \"The style is more nearly mature and the subject more nearly unified, and there are scenes that are more convincing than any in his previous fiction.\" <p>Published in 1922, it chronicles the relationship of Anthony Patch, Harvard-educated aspiring aesthete, and his beautiful wife, Gloria, as they wait to inherit his grandfather's fortune. A devastating satire of the nouveaux rich and New York's nightlife, of reckless ambition and squandered talent, it is also a shattering portrait of a marriage fueled by alcohol and wasted by wealth. <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, Fitzgerald wrote to Zelda in 1930, \"was all true.\"</p> <p>Lyrical, romantic, yet cruelly incisive, it signaled a new stage in Fitzgerald's career. With <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, H.L. Mencken commented in <i>The Smart Set</i>, \"Fitzgerald ceases to be a <i>wunderkind</i>, and begins to come into his maturity.</p>";
