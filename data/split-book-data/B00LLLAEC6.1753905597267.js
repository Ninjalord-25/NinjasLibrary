Lucifer, God's perfect creation and who dwelt in his very presence, walked in the midst of the stones of fire. Yet rose up to betray the Lord and bring Heaven itself to civil war. Many tales have referenced this great angelic war but few have sought to explore the dynamic relationships between God and the angelic hosts. Why did a third of heaven seek to overthrow their creator? </p> <p>See Lucifer and his actions in a light never before seen. Journey back to the beginning, and see the drama unfold before your eyes: As allegiances are broken; choices made, and why all of creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. The prequel to the Bible is here!</p>";
