window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Julie Kenner, aka J. Kenner. </p> <p>Kate Connor is your average, everyday mom with two kids, a husband, and one very big secret...she used to be a Demon Hunter for a secret arm of the Vatican. Now retired, she's more interested in the domestic than the demonic. So when she catches sight of a demon in Walmart, she tells herself it's some other Hunter's problem. But when that demon attacks her in her kitchen, retirement is no longer an option. </p> <p>Now Kate has to kick a little demon butt, figure out why the creatures are trying to take her out and take over her hometown, and at the same time take care of her two-year-old, deal with a hormonal 14-year-old, get the family to Catholic mass on time, and try to keep her past a secret from her daughter and her husband. </p> <p>She's a little out of practice, but hey...if she can juggle two kids and an impromptu dinner party, ridding the town of demons should be a piece of cake. Like the saying goes, <i>Carpe Demon</i>...and Kate intends to do just that. </p>";
