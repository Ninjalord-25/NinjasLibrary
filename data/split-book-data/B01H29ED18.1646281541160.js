window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ghosts are always hungry, someone once said and no one knows how ravenous they really are more than Ed and Lorraine Warren, the world's most renowned paranormal investigators. </p> <p>For decades, Ed and Lorraine Warren hunted down the truth behind the most terrifying supernatural occurrences across the nation and brought back astonishing evidence of their encounters with the unquiet dead. From the notorious house immortalized in <i>The Amityville Horror</i> to the bone-chilling events that inspired the hit film <i>The Conjuring</i>, the Warrens fearlessly probed the darkness of the world beyond our own, and documented the all-too-real experiences of the haunted and the possessed, the lingering deceased and the vengeful damned. </p> <p><i>Graveyard</i> chronicles a host of their most harrowing, fact-based cases of ghostly visitations, demonic stalking, heart-wrenching otherworldly encounters, and horrifying comeuppance from the spirit world. If you don't believe, you will. And whether you listen alone in the dead of night or in the middle of a sunny day, you'll be forever haunted by its gallery of specters eager to feed on your darkest dread. </p>";
