For one of the animal people working the underground of the recently rebuilt Vegas, what more could he want?</p> <p>Sure, his memory is sketchy, and he hasn't a clue of where he came from or how he came to be. But living in a world of awakened gods, magic users, high-tech gadgets, monsters, and all sorts of mythical creatures, well, that's just par for the course! As a freelance runner, Nash has got a solid rep, even if it is small time. But as long as he's getting fed, having fun, and getting laid, what else is there in life?</p> <p>Well, maybe that contract for picking up some gamer nerd. If he could score that one, well, that would definitely move him up.</p> <p>Now, if only Coyote hadn't taken an interest in him...</p>";
