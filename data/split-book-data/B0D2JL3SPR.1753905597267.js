window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>I, Taylor Hough, am a painfully average guy.</b></p> <p>I have a soul-destroying corporate job, I iron my underpants, and I was unceremoniously dumped for an influencer hippie a few years ago. Every day feels the same, and I don't know how much longer I can cope before I do something unhinged like rip off my shirt in the middle of my co-worker's office birthday party and smear lemon cake all over my chest.</p> <p>Then, a case of mistaken identity suddenly lands me in the middle of a covert professional wrestling league, which is apparently being run in the basement of my office building. Weird. Even weirder are the wrestlers. They seemâ€¦otherworldly. So does the rest of the staff. And the audience. Pretty much everyone except boring old me.</p> <p>And then there's the owner, Holt Hector, with whom I have an extremely embarrassing first encounter. He's ridiculously attractive, even in the inhuman cosplay get-up he's wearing that only makes him hotter if I'm being totally honest.</p> <p>Then, I discover it's not a costume. And that the show put on by Goliaths of Wrestling every night is a more monstrous reality than mind-blowing special effects.</p> <p>My previously boring life is suddenly no longer quite so average, and hot-as-hell Holt is inexplicably as interested in me and my ironed underpants as I am in him and his strange new world.</p>";
