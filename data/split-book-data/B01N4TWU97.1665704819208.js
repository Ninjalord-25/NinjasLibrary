Enter Sin du Jour, the expert caterers to demons, goblins, faeries, and everything in between. </p> <p>In their first month on the job, Lena Tarr and Darren Vargas, the newest line chefs at the supernatural catering agency, have had to approximate angel meat, evade amorous lizards, and provide craft sacrifices for a Hollywood debut.

And as if their new jobs weren't weird enough, now they have to deal with a very personal transformation on the behalf of their mysterious employer. As if surviving as a New York City chef weren't hard enough. </p> <p>This collection includes the first three Sin du Jour Affairs, <i>Envy of Angels</i>, <i>Lustlocked</i>, and <i>Pride's Spell</i> and the bonus short story \"Small Wars\". </p>";
