A fantasy masterwork.\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews - </i>starred review)</p> <p>Jackal and his fellow half-orcs patrol the barren wastes of the Lot Lands, spilling their own damned blood to keep civilized folk safe. A rabble of hard-talking, hog-riding, whore-mongering brawlers they may be, but the Bastards are Jackal's sworn brothers, fighting at his side in a land where there's no room for softness.</p> <p>And once Jackal's in charge - as soon as he can unseat the Bastards' tyrannical, seemingly unkillable founder - there's a few things they'll do different. Better.</p> <p>Or at least, that's the plan. Until the fallout from a deadly showdown makes Jackal start investigating the Lot Lands for himself. Soon, he's wondering if his feelings have blinded him to ugly truths about this world and the Bastards' place in it.</p> <p>In a quest for answers that takes him from decaying dungeons to the front lines of an ancient feud, Jackal finds himself battling invading orcs, rampaging centaurs, and grubby human conspiracies alike - along with a host of dark magics so terrifying they'd give even the heartiest Bastard pause.</p> <p>Finally, Jackal must ride to confront a threat that's lain in wait for generations, even as he wonders whether the Bastards can - or should - survive.</p> <p>Delivered with a generous wink to <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>, featuring sneaky-smart worldbuilding and gobs of fearsomely foul-mouthed charm, <i>The Grey Bastards</i> is a grimy, pulpy, masterpiece - and a raunchy, swaggering, cunningly clever adventure that's like nothing you've heard before.</p> <p> Praise for The Grey Bastards“Saddle up the war boar and set off on a wild, gory thrill-ride that ends in an awesome climax and begs for a sequel.” (<i>Daily Mail, UK</i>) </p> <p>“Non-stop action, though not for faint hearts.... The Grey Bastards live up to their name in all respects.” (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)</p>";
