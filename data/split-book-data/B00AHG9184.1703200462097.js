window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Christine Temetri is at her wits’ end. For years she’s covered the increasingly bizarre activities of End Times cults for the <i>Banner,</i> a religious news magazine. Yet Christine, who once dreamed of being a \"real\" writer, has nothing to show for the gig other than a regular paycheck and serious doubt that Armageddon will occur in time for her next deadline. But after a mysterious man entrusts her with a locked briefcase and orders to \"take it to Mercury\", Christine finds herself face-to-face with a ping-pong-playing angel by the name of Galileo Mercury. </p> <p>It seems Mercury was sent from heaven to make preparations for Armageddon, yet became sidetracked by the earthly delights he discovered: Rice Krispy treats, table tennis, and beer, to name just a few. Mercury’s concern for the fate of mankind is middling at best, but he is happy to educate Christine on the details of the elaborate, if poorly organized, calamity to come. When Christine inadvertently saves the Antichrist - an obnoxious, thirtysomething gamer who still lives with his mother - from celestial assassination, she begins an ambitious battle to stop the Apocalypse and save the world. But the heavenly host is nothing if not persistent, and Christine, aided only by an apathetic angel and a reluctant Antichrist, has her work cut out for her. </p> <p>Packed with outrageous characters, <i>Mercury Falls</i> is a viciously funny (and occasionally absurd) morality tale for the 21st century.</p>";
