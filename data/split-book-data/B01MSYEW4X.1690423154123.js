window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The history of American witches is way weirder than you ever imagined. From bewitched pigs hell-bent on revenge to gruesome 20th-century murders, <i>American Witches</i> reveals strange incidents of witchcraft that have long been swept under the rug as bizarre sidenotes to history. </p><p>On a tour through history that's both whimsical and startling, we'll encounter 17th-century children flying around inside their New England home \"like geese\". We'll meet a father-son team of pious Puritans who embarked on a mission that involved undressing ladies and overseeing hangings. And on the eve of the Civil War, we'll accompany a reporter as he dons a dress and goes searching for witches in New York City's most dangerous neighborhoods. </p><p>Entertainingly listenable and rich in amazing details often left out of today's texts, <i>American Witches</i> casts a flickering torchlight into the dark corners of American history. </p>";
