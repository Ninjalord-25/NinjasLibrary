window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In the tradition of modern fairy tales like Neil Gaiman's </b><b><i>American Gods</i></b><b> and&nbsp;Naomi Novik's </b><b><i>Spinning Silver </i></b><b>comes&nbsp;an immersive fantasy saga, a debut novel about&nbsp;estranged siblings who are reunited after receiving a mysterious inheritance.</b></p> <p><b>“A wonderfully imaginative, wholly enchanting novel of witness, survival, memory, and family that reads like a fairy tale godfathered by Neil Gaiman and Tim Burton in a wild America alive with wonders and devils alike. </b><b><i>Thistlefoot</i></b><b> shimmers with magic and mayhem and a thrilling emotional momentum.”—Libba Bray, bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Diviners</i></b></p> <p>The Yaga siblings—Bellatine, a young woodworker, and Isaac, a wayfaring street performer and con artist—have been estranged since childhood, separated both by resentment and by wide miles of American highway. But when they learn that they are to receive an inheritance, the siblings agree to meet—only to discover that their bequest isn’t land or money, but something far stranger: a sentient house on chicken legs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thistlefoot, as the house is called, has arrived from the Yagas’ ancestral home outside Kyiv—but not alone. A sinister figure known only as the Longshadow Man has tracked it to American shores, bearing with him violent secrets from the past: fiery memories that have hidden in Isaac and Bellatine’s blood for generations. As the Yaga siblings embark with Thistlefoot on a final cross-country tour of their family’s traveling theater show, the Longshadow Man follows in relentless pursuit, seeding destruction in his wake. Ultimately, time, magic, and legacy must collide—erupting in a powerful conflagration to determine who gets to remember the past and craft a new future. &nbsp;</p> <p>An enchanted adventure illuminated by Jewish myth and adorned with lyrical prose as tantalizing and sweet as briar berries, <i>Thistlefoot</i> is&nbsp;a sweeping epic rich in Eastern European folklore: a powerful and poignant exploration&nbsp;of healing from multi-generational trauma told by a bold new talent.</p>";
