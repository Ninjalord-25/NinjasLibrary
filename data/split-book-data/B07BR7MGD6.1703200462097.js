Sent on a mission to steal spells from the most dangerous family in the Underworld, she ends up stealing something else: their spell weaver.</b></p> <p>As a nymph living in exile among humans, Clio has picked up all sorts of unique survival skills. But pilfering magic from the Underworld's deadliest spell weavers? Not so much.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that's exactly what she has to do to earn a ticket back home.</p> <p>Conning her way into the Underworld may have gone pretty well, but now she's got a new problem. His name is Lyre, and he's a sinfully alluring incubus, a skilled spell weaver, and the only thing standing between her and stealing some damn magic.</p> <p>Maneuvering around him without blowing her cover shouldn't be that difficult, but chaos has been dogging her every step. Monsters hide behind beautiful face, and Lyre keeps saving her neck even though they're enemies. Kind of enemies? Either way, her mission is getting complicated fast, and in the Underworld, even one mistake could prove fatal.</p>";
