Rather than face prosecution, he decides instead to travel back in time to the Middle Ages and pose as a wizard.</p> <p>What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>An American hacker in King Arthur’s court, Martin must now train to become a full-fledged master of his powers, discover the truth behind the ancient wizard Merlin…and not, y’know, die or anything.</p>";
