window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Apprentice assassin Arek Winterthorn has a power even he himself doesn't understand. Unable to cast even the simplest of spells, he can still disrupt the magic of others with a single touch.

This will save their people, but potentially at the cost of Arek's life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus begins an epic quest brimming with betrayals, plot twists, violence, and intrigue. Silbane and Arek will fight relentlessly in battles and skirmishes against mages, dwarves, elves, and even dragons, but their true adversary may be each other. In the end, they will be faced with the ultimate question: What sacrifice is too great for the good of their people and their world?&nbsp;</p> <p>With non-stop action, an intricate mix of powerful magic and deadly martial arts, <i>Mythborn</i> brings to life a world filled with creatures and gods from legend crafted by the designer of the award-winning&nbsp;<i>Elder Scrolls: Arena</i> and martial-arts master, V.
