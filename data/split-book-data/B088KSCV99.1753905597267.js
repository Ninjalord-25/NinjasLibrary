In fact, the game company is so sure they will always be right that you can’t remake your character.</p> <p>The unthinkable happened. The safeties and the guarantees failed, not just once but apparently only to them. The company has informed them that the system is infallible: There is nothing they will do. Players must use what they are given, so Seth and his team have no other choice - they need to grind it out and evolve their gifts in time to stream.</p> <p>Loading...Welcome to Mephisto’s Magic Online!</p>";
