Plus, it has lots of action and a great cast of characters. Not to mention an orca and a polar bear!\" (Ann Leckie, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author and winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Clarke Awards)</b> </p> <p>After the climate wars, a floating city is constructed in the Arctic Circle, a remarkable feat of mechanical and social engineering, complete with geothermal heating and sustainable energy. The city's denizens have become accustomed to a roughshod new way of living; however, the city is starting to fray along the edges - crime and corruption have set in, the contradictions of incredible wealth alongside direst poverty are spawning unrest, and a new disease called \"the breaks\" is ravaging the population. </p> <p>When a strange new visitor arrives - a woman riding an orca, with a polar bear at her side - the city is entranced. The \"orcamancer\", as she's known, very subtly brings together four people - each living on the periphery - to stage unprecedented acts of resistance. By banding together to save their city before it crumbles under the weight of its own decay, they will learn shocking truths about themselves. </p> <p><i>Blackfish City</i> is a remarkably urgent - and ultimately very hopeful - novel about political corruption, organized crime, technology run amok, the consequences of climate change, gender identity, and the unifying power of human connection. </p>";
