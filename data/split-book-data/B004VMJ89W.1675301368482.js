And look online. </p><p>Choosing a god isn't as simple as you would think. There are too many choices; and they often have very hefty prices for their eternal devotion: blood, money, sacrifices, and vows of chastity. But then they find Luka, raccoon god of prosperity. All he wants is a small cut of their good fortune. Oh - and to crash on their couch for a few days. </p><p><i>Divine Misfortune</i> is a story of gods and mortals - in worship, in love, and at parties.</p>";
