But when Siyon accidentally commits an act of impossible magic, he’s catapulted into the limelight—which is a bad place to be when the planes start lurching out of alignment, threatening to send Bezim into the sea.</p> <p>It will take a miracle to save the city. Good thing Siyon has pulled off the impossible before. Now he just has to master it.</p> <p><b>A dazzling fantasy bursting with wild magic, chaotic sword-fighting street gangs, brazen flirting, malevolent harpies, and one defiant alchemist.</b></p> <p><b>\"From the razor-sharp social climbing to the glimmering alchemist's library to the hidden realms beneath it all, I loved getting lost in this dazzling debut.\"</b>—Shannon Chakraborty </p>";
