window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Rast went to the Ren Faire looking for a fight. Well, a simulated fight, with blunt swords and safety equipment. But when his final opponent turns into a living, fire-breathing dragon, John finds himself in the fight of his life. It's John or nothing stopping a disaster in its tracks - and the only real weapon at hand is his mom's Volvo. So John decides to let it roll....</p> <p>And that's when destiny comes to call. John is spirited away to the well-hidden base of Knight Watch, the organization that stands between humanity and the real nasties the rest of the world doesn't know about.</p> <p>Knight Watch would be John's dream job - except for the storm goddess that destroys his parents' house, the abandoned mall replete with too much dead, and the Fetch that aims to make John's domain a final resting place. All this has John's putative allies in the Knight Watch worried that John is the one bringing bad things into multiple worlds. John and his reluctant teammates have to figure out who, or what, is pulling the strings before all of Knight Watch falls prey to a well-concealed puppet master and far worse things enter this world.</p>";
