window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Urmatia needs heroes.</b></p> <p>In a world of interactive game stats, gods speaking through a System, weapon arts, magic cores, and supernatural creatures, the balance has been tilted. Vicious monsters and widespread mists plague the lands. Nefarious gods and villainous agents work in concert to bring ruin.</p> <p>Urmatia needs heroes. That's where John comes in. He's a young boxer who died in one world and got a second chance to help a new one. It's a hard responsibility. Everything has a cost. But when other heroes crumble, John raises his fist, ready for more.</p> <p>The System is XP and level-up based. The unique part is the System-based abilities that can be learned through the collection of magic cores, little orbs that have magical abilities, and weapon arts—a person has certain weapons that match them. There are quests, individual achievements, stats to gain, and recognition by the System for providing the greatest service/efforts during mass party quests, and more.</p>";
