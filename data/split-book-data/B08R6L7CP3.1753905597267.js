Only kept alive so they can steal my blood. </p> <p>Until one evening when four eerily gorgeous men break me out of my prison. </p> <p>They give me a soft bed and delicious food. They say they'll protect me â€” but their generosity may come at a price. </p> <p>My rescuers are monsters like my captors: fae who shift into wolves. A curse gripping the faerie realm turns them wild under the full moon. Only my blood can cure their rage. </p> <p>These fearsome men need me, and not just to lift the curse. A tragedy left them outcasts, and offering me to their rulers could win them back the home and the power they lost. </p> <p>No matter how kindly they treat me, no matter how their smoldering eyes and strong hands stir unfamiliar desires in both my body and my heart, their castle is just another prison. As long as I'm a prize more than a person, my life will never be my own. </p> <p>I've survived this long without giving up. I won't roll over now. But how can one damaged human girl hold her own against the savage fae? </p> <p><i>Captive of Wolves</i> is the first in a new paranormal romance saga featuring possessive wolf shifters, fraught fae politics, and a wounded heroine coming into her own. Grab it now and get swept away in the fantasy!</p>";
