window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On March 16, 1992, Elizabeth DeCaro, a 28 year-old mother of four, was found dead in her own home, murdered execution-style with two bullets to the head. Her husband, Rick, was immediately a suspect, having previously struck her \"accidentally\" with the family van after taking out a $100,000 life insurance policy on her. <i>A Killer Among Us</i> presents the true shocking story of Elizabeth's family and their search for justice against the man who continued to play father to the children whose mother he had killed. </p> <p>This real-life case has fascinating legal elements - three trials, a death penalty conviction, and a dramatic reversal in federal court - and has received extensive local and national coverage. </p> <p>Charles Bosworth Jr. is the author of the New York Times best sellers <i>Previous Victims</i> and <i>Silent Witness</i>. </p>";
