He looked a bit too much like Aaron, you see.</p> <p>Now it’s Aaron’s job to step up, lest his death correct that little mix-up.

The more he learns of what brought dear dead Markus to that fatal alleyway, the more he has to wonder just what the world’s savior was really up to the night the wrong boy died.</p>";
