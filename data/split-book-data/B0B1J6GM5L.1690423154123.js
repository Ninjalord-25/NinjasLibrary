window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Uh, I always hate doing introductions. Let's see...I'm Mark from Pensacola, a sprawling town in Florida. Don't judge me too harshly. There are plenty of decent jobs, cheap rent, and affordable schooling. I work at Pete's Pancake's, loving the night shift. Well, one evening, a mysterious woman comes into the diner, dripping blood from a cut on her hand. She's not drunk like the usual ones, she's wearing cosplay with pockets, and she leaves an odd spark coursing through me when I bandage her wound. After returning to visit me during my shifts for a full week, we build up a chemistry, only to have it vanish when she disappears.</p> <p>To be honest, I put her behind me, finishing off my business degree and eager to finally get a daytime job just like my like parents hoped for. Slight problem, though; the same stunning woman stumbles up to my tiny apartment building without an invitation, showering my carpet in her blood. She swears she'll heal by morning, or I can take her to the hospital. Here's the craziest part: Magic knits her wound closed. When I plead for her to tell me what happened, I wished I never opened my mouth.</p>";
