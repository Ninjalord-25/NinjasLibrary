Most of the scars healed. Except for the one that went all the way through.</p> <p><i>You wouldn’t think that the serial murders of children and the one who got away would have any connection with the strange fate of one of Jupiter’s moons.</i></p> <p>Two decades later, when Daphne goes missing again, it’s nothing new.&nbsp;</p> <p>As her exes might agree, running is what she does best, so her brother Tanner sets out one more time to find her.
