window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A \"wondrously frightening\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) tale of terror and number-one national best seller about a writer's pseudonym that comes alive and destroys everyone on the path that leads to the man who created him. </p> <p>Thad Beaumont would like to say he is innocent. He'd like to say he has nothing to do with the twisted imagination that produced his best-selling novels. He'd like to say he has nothing to do with the series of monstrous murders that keep coming closer to his home. But how can Thad deny the ultimate embodiment of evil that goes by the name he gave it - and signs its crimes with Thad's bloody fingerprints? </p> <p><i>The Dark Half</i> is \"a chiller\" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), so real and fascinating that you'll find yourself squirming in Stephen King's heart-stopping, blood-curdling grip - and loving every minute of it. </p>";
