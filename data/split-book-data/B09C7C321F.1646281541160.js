window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nukes ended most of society. Now all that's left is taxes.</b></p> <p>Arthur McDowell works for the most indestructible employer left in post-apocalyptic America: the IRS. Safe and sound inside a government bunker, Arthur is proud to be just another drone. But for an ambitious man (and excellent typist) such as Arthur, a promotion to supervisor is just around the corner.</p> <p>Arthur's world flips when instead of a becoming supervisor, the brass makes him a census-taker. His task: to head out into the irradiated streets armed with paperwork and red tape. Assigned to him is a drug-addicted bodyguard, Rabia Duke, who could care less if they survive.</p> <p>All's well at first, but after Arthur is confronted by a warlord, he realizes that the only thing that can save them all is a massive audit. Because even above radiation, roving gangs, and starvation, what the world should fear the most remains bureaucracy. A <i>happy</i> bureaucracy.</p> <p>Brazil by way of Mad Max, M.P. Fitzgerald's <i>A Happy Bureaucracy</i> is a bleak and hilarious look at the wheels of a system that keep turning, even when nothing else is left. Get your copy today!</p>";
