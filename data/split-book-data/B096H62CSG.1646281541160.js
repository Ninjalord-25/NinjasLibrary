window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to 2050. I’m Rachel, and there’s a monster inside me that makes me a perfect assassin. Like everyone else, I’m indentured to a Family. I do their dirty work.</p> <p>Someone’s pet geneticist toyed with my sister, and now she’s not human either. When I find them, they’re going to make her right, and then I’m going to tear them apart. Tania’s the only real family I have. Killing whoever gets in my way is the easy part; enlisting my ex-lover’s help - not so much. I don’t have time to dredge up those old emotions.</p> <p><i>Night of the Ghoul</i> is the first in a series of four and a mashup of Urban Fantasy, Dystopian, and Cyberpunk.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: This book contains adult language, explicit sexual content, and some depictive scenes of intense blood and gore.</p>";
