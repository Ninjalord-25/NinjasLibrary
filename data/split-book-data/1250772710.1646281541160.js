window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Award-winning author Andrea Hairston weaves together African folktales and postcolonial literature into unforgettable fantasy in </b><b><i>Master of Poisons </i></b></p> <p>The world is changing. Poison desert eats good farmland. Once-sweet water turns foul. The wind blows sand and sadness across the Empire. To get caught in a storm is death. To live and do nothing is death. There is magic in the world, but good conjure is hard to find.&nbsp;</p> <p>Djola, righthand man and spymaster of the lord of the Arkhysian Empire, is desperately trying to save his adopted homeland, even in exile.</p> <p>Awa, a young woman training to be a powerful griot, tests the limits of her knowledge and comes into her own in a world of sorcery, floating cities, kindly beasts, and uncertain men.</p> <p>Awash in the rhythms of folklore and storytelling and rich with Hairston's characteristic lush prose, <i>Master of Poisons </i>is epic fantasy that will bleed your mind with its turns of phrase and leave you aching for the world it burns into being.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Kirkus Reviews Best Books of the Year - 2020 </b></p> <p>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor.com&nbsp;</p>";
