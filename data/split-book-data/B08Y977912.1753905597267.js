Things look even brighter when he makes a connection with the sweet but shy new barista at his favorite coffee shop. Maybe, a guy really can have it all...but appearances can be deceiving. </p> <p>Apparition just wants her supervillain father to be proud of her, and she'll do anything to accomplish that: even disguise herself as mild-mannered coffee shop employee Nikki to get close to the superhero he's stalking. However, between his charming smile and kind words, she finds herself hopelessly drawn the good-natured Shawn. </p> <p>As the chemistry between Shawn and Nikki sizzles, the tension between Surge and Apparition grows.
