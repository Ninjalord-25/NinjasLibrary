window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of the Bad Games and Wildlife series comes a chilling new novel of supernatural horror and suspense.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Highland Elementary has a dark and disturbing past...so disturbing that locals ultimately burned the school to the ground.</p> <p>Years later, Pinewood Elementary is the future, and for new teacher Ryan Herb, a chance at a fresh start. But the townspeople don’t believe that rebuilding the school and changing its name is enough. They believe that whatever evil inhabited the halls of Highland still dwells in Pinewood.</p> <p>Ryan is a realist and isn’t the type to be affected by local lore. But when Ryan begins to experience horrifying visions of past tragedies, he starts to question his own beliefs. Something in the school is reaching out to Ryan for help, a potentially lethal request as something else - or someone else - in the school is keen on keeping the evil therein very much alive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can a skeptical Ryan unearth the origins of the evil’s true source and put an end to it? Or will he, like many before him, become a permanent resident of the school himself?&nbsp;</p> <p>Rife with supernatural terror and intrigue, <i>Dark Halls</i> blurs the lines between horror and mystery - a whodunit that, when solved, proposes the even greater question of: How do you stop it?</p> <p>I hope you enjoy <i>Dark Halls</i>, my friends. This book is ideal for fans of authors who pen various types of horror, suspense, and mystery fiction, like Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Richard Laymon, Joe Hill, John Saul, Paul Tremblay, Blake Crouch, Brian Keene, Robert R. McCammon, Peter Straub, Clive Barker, Darcy Coates, Willow Rose, and many, many more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Happy listening!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
