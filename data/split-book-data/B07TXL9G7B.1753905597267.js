There are rules. Expectations. </p> <p>The title of alpha isn't given lightly, it's earned through a trial that will test her in ways she never expected. </p> <p>Left with no choice but to fight for her new status as alpha, Amber must pull together her fledgling pack of werewolves that never wanted to be more than human. Time is ticking as they prepare for the night that could tear them apart. If Amber fails the alpha trials, they’ll lose a lot more than their humanity. </p> <p>They’ll lose their freedom.</p> <p><i>Note:</i> This is <b>not </b>a reverse harem story.</p> <p><b>If you like Patricia Briggs, Faith Hunter, Kim Harrison, MD Massey, Shayne Silvers, CN Crawford, Steve McHugh, Shannon Mayer, or K.F.
