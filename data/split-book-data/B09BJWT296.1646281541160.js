window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>They’re only badass by accident.</b></p> <p>Vola might be new to this whole adventuring thing, but she’s pretty sure this isn’t how you’re supposed to save the day. No one at her academy wanted an orc as a paladin, so they’ve sent her to the back end of a swamp, hoping she’ll never find a quest good enough to earn her shield. Well, screw that. Vola’s got divine help, and even a laughingstock of a goddess can do some righteous smiting.</p> <p>Armed with a new mission to find some missing orphans, Vola just needs a team to help her track them down. Beggars can’t be choosers, but couldn’t her goddess have sent her at least one competent fighter? Now, she’s stuck with a hyperactive halfling, a klutzy spell caster, and a cloaked mystery who’s a little too good with their knives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can a half-orc paladin keep her new party alive in a swamp that’s determined to eat them, or are all the naysayers right and orcs really can’t be heroes?</p>";
