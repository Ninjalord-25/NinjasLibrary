He’s become comfortable with the lonely but predictable way he's survived since he died in 1973, when vampire lord Carson Fitzgerald turned him.</p> <p>Now, however, Fitzgerald has returned to Los Angeles, and is demanding his children tend to his needs in a rather unpleasant way. To get the girl and remain unliving, Pete’s gonna have to take the fight to Fitzgerald by joining forces with the prissy Hollywood vampires who have always annoyed the hell out of him—and that's when the shit is gonna hit the fangs!</p>";
