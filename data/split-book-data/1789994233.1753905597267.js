Adventure awaits, as Felix records the mighty deeds of Gotrek Gurnisson, Trollslayer. </p> <p><b>Listen to It Because: </b>This collection of stories is where the saga of Gotrek began. Mutants in the forest, goblins in the mountains, a troll beneath the world - from these small beginnings came the greatest partnership in the Old World and a hero who has crossed realities and become a legend. </p> <p><b>The Story:</b> Gotrek and Felix: unsung heroes of the Empire or nothing more than common thieves and murderers? The truth perhaps lies somewhere in between and depends entirely upon whom you ask.... </p> <p>After fleeing the authorities in the Imperial city of Altdorf, Felix Jaeger swears a drunken oath to dour dwarf Gotrek Gurnisson to record his death saga. In the cold light of day, Felix's worst fears are confirmed as he learns that Gotrek is a Trollslayer - a dwarf doomed to seek out a heroic death in battle to atone for an unknown personal disgrace. Their travels throw them into a string of extraordinary adventures as Felix tries to survive his companion's destiny. </p> <p>Written by William King. Narrated by Jonathan Keeble.</p>";
