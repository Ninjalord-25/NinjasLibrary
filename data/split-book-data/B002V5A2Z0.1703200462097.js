window.bookSummaryJSON = "In Christopher Moore's ingenious debut novel, we meet one of the most memorably mismatched pairs in the annals of literature. The good-looking one is 100-year-old ex-seminarian and \"roads\" scholar Travis O'Hearn. The green one is Catch, a demon with a nasty habit of eating most of the people he meets. <p>Behind the fake Tudor fa√ßade of Pine Cove, California, Catch sees a four-star buffet. Travis, on the other hand, thinks he sees a way of ridding himself of his toothy traveling companion. The winos, neo-pagans, and deadbeat Lotharios of Pine Cove, meanwhile, have other ideas. And none of them is quite prepared when all hell breaks loose.</p>";
