window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Sherrilyn Kenyon debuts a sweeping new epic saga sure to appeal to her millions of fans! </p> <p>Deadmen tell their tales.... </p> <p>To catch evil, it takes evil. Enter Devyl Bane - an ancient dark warlord returned to the human realm as one of the most notorious pirates in the New World. A man of many secrets, Bane makes a pact with Thorn - an immortal charged with securing the worst creations the ancient gods ever released into our world. Those powers have been imprisoned for eons behind enchanted gates...gates that are beginning to buckle. At Thorn's behest, Bane takes command of a crew of Deadmen, and together they are humanity's last hope to restore the gates and return the damned to their hell realms. </p> <p>But things are never so simple. And one of Bane's biggest problems is the ship they sail upon. For the <i>Sea Witch</i> isn't just a vessel; she's also a woman born of an ancient people he wronged and who in turn wronged him during a centuries-long war between their two races - a woman who is also sister to their primary target. Now Marcelina, the Sea Witch, must choose. Either she remains loyal to her evil sister and almost-extinct race against Bane and his cause, and watches humanity fall, or she puts faith in an enemy who has already betrayed her. Her people over the totality of humanity - let's hope Bane can sway her favor. </p> <p><i>Deadmen Walking</i> is the first historical fantasy title in <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Sherrilyn Kenyon's Deadman's Cross series. It is a tale of passion and loss, emotions that wound and heal...and ultimate redemption. </p>";
