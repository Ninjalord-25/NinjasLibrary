window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This Jamaican-inspired fantasy debut about two enemy witches who must enter into a deadly alliance to take down a common enemy has the twisted cat-and-mouse of </b><b><i>Killing Eve&nbsp;</i></b><b>with the richly imagined fantasy world of </b><b><i>Furyborn </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Ember in the Ashes</i></b><b>.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Divided by their order. United by their vengeance. </b></p> <p>Iraya has spent her life in a cell, but every day brings her closer to freedom - and vengeance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jazmyne is the queen’s daughter, but unlike her sister before her, she has no intention of dying to strengthen her mother’s power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sworn enemies, these two witches enter a precarious alliance to take down a mutual threat. But power is intoxicating, revenge is a bloody pursuit, and nothing is certain - except the lengths they will go to win this game.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"A thundering waterfall of magic, vengeance and intrigue.\" (Samantha Shannon, <i>New York Times &amp; Sunday Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Priory of the Orange Tree </i>and <i>The Bone Season</i>)</p>";
