The Great War grips the world - and from the Western Front a strange story emerges...a story of St. George and a brigade of angels descending from heaven to fight beside the beleaguered British troops. But can there be any truth to it?</p> <p>H. G. Wells, the most celebrated writer of his day - author of <i>The Time Machine</i>, <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, <i>The Invisible Man</i> - is dispatched to find out. There, he finds an eerie wasteland inhabited by the living, the dead, and those forever stranded somewhere in between...a no-man’s-land whose unhappy souls trail him home to London, where a deadly plot, one that could turn the tide of war, is rapidly unfolding.</p> <p>In league with his young love, the reporter and suffragette Rebecca West, Wells must do battle with diabolical forces - secret agents and depraved occultists - to save his sanity, his country, and ultimately the world.</p>";
