window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Emerging from the winter storm, it appeared to be a sanctuary, shelter from the freezing blizzard and the ravages of a desperate, final battle. But instead, the beckoning gates of the mysterious abbey are the entrance to a different kind of hell. The frightening shadows and maze of confusing hallways and rooms conceal things much more terrifying than the enemy beyond the walls. Sergeant Muller and his German Army platoon have witnessed countless horrors since the start of the war, but they still don't believe in ghosts or the dead returning from the grave. That's all about to change. </p>";
