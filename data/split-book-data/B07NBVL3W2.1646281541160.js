window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 1 of the best-selling Spellshadow series.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A magic school story with a spine-tingling twist, for adults or teens who enjoyed Harry Potter...</b></p> <p><i>What would you do if you spotted a man following a young woman, but no-one else could see him?</i></p> <p>Like most sane people, student Alex Webber thought he was hallucinating&nbsp;-&nbsp;perhaps he'd consumed something bad at the party he'd been attending that night, or he was severely overtired.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when he sees the mysterious man following Natalie again the very next day, he can no longer disbelieve his eyes.</p> <p>Although she denies the man's existence, Alex sees her walking with him down a road in his neighborhood he's never seen before&nbsp;-&nbsp;and can't help but follow. After a bizarre, but strangely short journey, he finds himself standing before a towering iron gate wreathed in gray ivy, behind which looms a decrepit old mansion named Spellshadow Manor.</p> <p>Spellshadow, with its beautiful yet sinisterly decorated hallways, ever-changing outdoor&nbsp;scenery&nbsp;and very unusual residents... Alex will quickly learn it is a place that is as wondrous as it is deadly.</p> <p>Especially for a normal person like him.</p> <p><i>What if you found yourself recruited to an institute of magic, only to discover you really couldn't do magic?</i></p> <p><i>What if your enrollment there was all one big, terrible mistake?</i></p> <p>If you were at Spellshadow, you'd keep it a secret. A deep, dark, deadly secret...</p> <p>Because Spellshadow's elusive Head is hiding a secret of his own&nbsp;- one that Alex soon realizes he and Natalie must uncover at all costs if either of them wishes to leave the Manor alive...&nbsp;and before it's too late.</p> <p><b>Mystery, suspense, and oodles of twists and turns; an unforgettable experience awaits you in Spellshadow Manor... Welcome in.</b></p>";
