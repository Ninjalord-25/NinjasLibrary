window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"A fantastic book, full of wit and sharp humor, <i>City of Iron and Dust</i> careens through a modernized faerie at a breakneck pace, full of verve and unforgettable characters. Oakes spins a smart, electric, and sometimes snarky tale, showing that the beating heart of modern fantasy is alive and well.\" (John Hornor Jacobs, author of <i>A Lush and Seething Hell</i> and <i>The Incorruptibles</i>)</p> <p>The Iron City is a prison, a maze, an industrial blight. It is the result of a war that saw the goblins grind the fae beneath their collective boot heels. And tonight, it is also a city that churns with life. Tonight, a young fae is trying to make his fortune one drug deal at a time; a goblin princess is searching for a path between her own dreams and others' expectations; her bodyguard is deciding who to kill first; an artist is hunting for his own voice; an old soldier is starting a new revolution; a young rebel is finding fresh ways to fight; and an old goblin is dreaming of reclaiming her power over them all. Tonight, all their stories are twisting together, wrapped up around a single bag of Dust - the only drug that can still fuel fae magic - and its fate and theirs will change the Iron City forever.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
