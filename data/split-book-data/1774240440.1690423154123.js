However, he is about to go on the biggest trip of his life when the X-ranked adventurer Jeris Cowl takes the young Royal Ooze for special training far away in the mystical planes of the Aether, a land beyond mortality, where the Heavens and Hells clash and eldritch entities of primordial energy reign as gods over entire universes.</p> <p>The Void watches, and seeks to subvert the hero chosen by Fate to stop it, however.
