Too many people trying to kill him.</p> <p>But now his sister's been brutally murdered and Carter wants to find out why.</p> <p>Was it the gangster looking to settle a score? The ghost of a mage he killed the night he left town? Maybe it's the patron saint of violent death herself, Santa Muerte, who's taken an unusually keen interest in him.</p> <p>Carter's going to find out who did it, and he's going to make them pay.</p> <p>As long as they don't kill him first.</p>";
