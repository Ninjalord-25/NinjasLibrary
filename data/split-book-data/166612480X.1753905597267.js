window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Paranormal Women's Fiction adventure for those who believe that finding your true self late in life is a blessing, not a curse - even if it turns out you may actually be cursed.</p> <p>After finding my soon-to-be ex-husband together with my soon-to-be ex-assistant, I realize his \"for better or for worse\" didn't include my 40s.</p> <p>An extended vacation on a remote Italian island sounds like the perfect antidote to a midlife crisis - until I arrive. I'm expecting Chianti and pasta. What I get is a run-down bed-and-breakfast with the oldest Nonna in existence.</p> <p>There's something about this island. Something odd. Like how everyone keeps calling me Mamma or how I'm the first tourist in decades.</p> <p>And that's before I wake up to a talking chipmunk holding a glass of wine. He says I have something ancient in me, and for once, it's not my creaking joints.</p> <p>When I finally discover the island's deepest secrets, I know my 40s are about to be fabulous, if only I can survive long enough to enjoy them.</p>";
