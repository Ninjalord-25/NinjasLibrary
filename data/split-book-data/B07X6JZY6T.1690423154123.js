window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alexander C. Kane, author of the smash-hit Andrea Vernon series, brings his signature humor to the adventures of an unlikely, tenacious new heroine in this fantastic free-for-all. <b> </b></p> <p>Gretch Wolgast is a bit of a dud. Just ask her. She’s a 21-year-old college dropout who has a loser job at the mall. Sure, she can lift a tennis ball with her telekinetic powers. But only three feet in the air. And she has to be sitting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gretch is an OP, one of thousands born in Orlando, Florida, in the early 1980s who mysteriously developed the ability to move things with their minds. Unfortunately, she turned out to be the weakest of the bunch.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Shaq left town to join the Lakers, and it's been downhill ever since.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, Gretch’s life is being turned upside down. She witnesses a murder and discovers a wide-ranging conspiracy that could destroy her hometown and all the OP.&nbsp;</p> <p>And she might be the only one powerful enough to stop it.</p>";
