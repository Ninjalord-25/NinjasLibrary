window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the city of Magic's Bend, I protect what's mine. To the world, I'm a feeble Conjurer. To my closest friends, I'm a dangerous Magica with unexplainable powers given to me by a dragon. The downside? If anyone discovers what I am, I'm dead. So I lay low - kicking ass with my weapons, not my magic. </p> <p>Things go to hell when I witness the murder of a powerful vampire ally and become the key suspect. Soon, I'm hunted by the sexiest, strongest supernatural I've ever met. Ares is an unheard of vampire hybrid, and it's hard to say if he wants to screw me or screw me over. </p> <p>I've got three days to catch the real killer. The bad news? It will take my forbidden magic to succeed. But can I control it, much less keep my secret with Ares watching my every move? </p> <p>I'm used to protecting others...now I have to protect myself. </p>";
