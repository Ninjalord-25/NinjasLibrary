window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Angie Fox, the first book in the new Southern Ghost Hunter mysteries. </p> <p>One simple mistake, for a girl who is about to lose her family home, releases the ghost of a long-dead gangster and opens Verity Long's eyes to a whole new world. </p> <p>When out-of-work graphic designer Verity Long accidentally traps a ghost on her property, she's saddled with more than a supernatural sidekick - she gains the ability to see spirits. It leads to an offer she can't refuse from the town's bad boy, the brother of her ex and the last man she should ever partner with. Ellis Wyatt is in possession of a stunning historic property haunted by some of Sugarland, Tennessee's finest former citizens. Only some of them are growing restless - and destructive. He hires Verity to put an end to the disturbances. </p> <p>But soon Verity learns there's more to the mysterious estate than floating specters, secret passageways, and hidden rooms. There's a modern-day mystery afoot, one that hinges on a decades-old murder. Verity isn't above questioning the living or the dead. But can she discover the truth before the killer finds her? </p>";
