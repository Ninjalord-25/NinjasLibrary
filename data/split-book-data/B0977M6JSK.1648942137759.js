window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What’s worse than finding a dead girl in your boss’ office? Becoming suspect number one in her murder.</p> <p>When my impossibly sexy boss, Mr Nox, steps in and offers to help I’m initially relieved. But his help comes with a caveat. He wants something in return. Oh, and here’s the kicker. He claims he’s Lucifer. The devil. A God of Sin.</p> <p>Things don’t go my way, and I’m forced to accept a deal with the devil. I know what he wants. I can see the burning desire dancing in his piercing blue eyes. He wants me. And the longer I spend in his company, the more I begin to crave his touch, his kiss, his fierce passion. But if I give myself to him, he may never let me go. He claims that he is cursed, and believes I may be his salvation. I’m starting to wonder if he could be mine.</p> <p><i>Lucifer’s Curse is a steamy fantasy romance with an HEA and fully consensual adult situations. If you like outrageously hot men with Irish accents and big wings, you’re going to love Nox.</i></p> <p><i>From the author of the best-selling Hades Trials comes a brand new, spicier, paranormal romance.</i></p>";
