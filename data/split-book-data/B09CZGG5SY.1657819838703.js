window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A poison that’s impossible to trace and a diary that holds the key to the antidote: the only problem? Its owner died 18 years ago.</p> <p>Erica Hutchinson hasn’t had the easiest life so far: orphaned at eight, a single mother by 18, and a sadistic maniac for an uncle. Oh, and let’s not overlook the supernatural abilities she’d happily forget in a heartbeat. The secrets she’s worked so hard to keep for the last 26 years will soon turn her world upside down. Someone is killing Erica’s kind, and they are dangerously close to extinction. To make things worse, the poison is spreading to humans, too. Can Erica find the antidote before it’s too late? Contains mature themes, swearing, scenes of graphic violence, and sexual assault.</p>";
