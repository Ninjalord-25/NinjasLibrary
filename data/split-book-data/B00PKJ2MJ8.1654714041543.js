window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Melena Sanders faced her fair share of danger with insurgents and terrorists when she served in the U.S. Army, but now she is about to go up against a new threat. Her best friend, Aniya, has disappeared while on a trip to Fairbanks, Alaska - a supernatural haven. Most humans have no idea darker races lurk amongst them. Mel knows better. If she wants to get her friend back, she's going to have to go in alone - but not unarmed. Melena has a few special skills the Army didn't provide, but the odds are still against her. And danger likes to play it rough. A war for power is about to rise in Fairbanks, and if she wants to get Aniya back, Mel is going to have to step right into the middle of it. </p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
