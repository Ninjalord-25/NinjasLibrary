Never speak or look at The Royals, the powerful princes destined to rule each of their kingdoms. Avoid the human world. </p> <p>Of course, I’ve already broken all the rules. </p> <p>There’s something different about me. Something that’s not pure. I’m not like the other dragon shifters. Maybe it’s because of my human blood. </p> <p>The Royals have noticed me, and every girl at the Academy hates me. </p> <p>I never knew the paranormal world existed until one day I have a fight with Mom, I come home to find her gone, and poof, I’m a dragon shifter. </p> <p>It would have been nice if Mom would have told me. But then again, secrets rule my family....</p> <p>But now she’s been kidnapped and I have no answers. I have to find her. </p> <p>Some powerful demon is after me, because supposedly I’m a threat to his power. Which is crazy! Has he seen me in class? </p> <p>Grab this new romance academy and enroll in Legacy where you’ll meet dragons, wolves, demons, Fae, and vampires!</p>";
