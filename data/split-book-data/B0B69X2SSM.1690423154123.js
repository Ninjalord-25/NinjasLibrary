His girlfriend is lost in another dimension, his apartment’s been staked out by werewolves, and to top it all off, he’s flat broke.</p> <p>Too bad there’s no rest for the wicked. Monstrous beasts of biblical proportions have been unleashed upon the world, leaving Bill with a mighty big question—how the hell is one poor-ass vamp supposed to stop something the size of a battleship?</p> <p>All’s not lost, though. With a magic hammer by his side along with friends too stupid to quit, Bill will have to pierce the veil and explore a strange new world for answers. Success will mean saving everyone he knows, including his lost love. If he fails, however, it’ll be far more than just his credit rating that’s left in ruins.</p> <p>Gamer, geek, and legendary vampire Bill Ryder is back in the latest novel of the Bill of the Dead series by best-selling urban-fantasy author Rick Gualtieri.</p> <p>If you enjoy <i>Jim Butcher</i>, <i>Hunter Blain</i>, <i>Orlando Sanchez</i>, or <i>Shane Silvers</i>, then dive neck-first into this side-splitting world of horror hilarity today.</p>";
