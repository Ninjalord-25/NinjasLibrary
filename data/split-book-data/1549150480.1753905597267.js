Two hundred years later, her legacy lives on in the scions of two very different lines: one dedicated to using their powers to heal and help women in need; the other, determined to grasp power for themselves by whatever means necessary. </p> <p>This clash will play out in the fate of Annis, a young woman in Gilded Age New York who finds herself a pawn in the family struggle for supremacy. She'll need to claim her own power to save herself-and resist succumbing to the darkness that threatens to overcome them all. </p> <p>\"Narrator Polly Lee brings her own brand of magic to a story of witches at a time when women were not allowed to be agents of their own destiny. Her vocal choices craft exceptionally bright and well-defined characters of different classes who embody distinct styles, and personalities. Her voices create a polished performance full of the vocal subtleties of a well-told story.\" (<i>AudioFile</i>) </p> <p>\"Morgan's beautifully conjured tale of three women, social mores, and the sanctity of self-determination is thoroughly enthralling.\" (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review) </p> <p>\"Morganâ€™s incantatory prose and independent-minded women will delight fans of Alice Hoffman and Sarah Addison Allen with this tale of female self-realization and magical realism.
