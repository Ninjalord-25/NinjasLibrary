When life gives you lemons...give yourself a magical makeover!</b></p> <p>One day, I'm married, living in the triangle, and working as a head nurse at one of the country's best hospitals. The next, I've shed a 175 pounds of idiot and find myself encountering ghosts, dragons, and pixies while taking care of a sick patient. </p> <p>Losing my sanity didn't seem like the worst thing to happen since I moved back home with my mom and nana. But I have to make the best of this mess for the sake of my children. And I refuse to give my ex the satisfaction of knowing he literally drove me crazy.</p> <p>I didn't mind rolling with the punches.... I just never imagined those hits would come in the form of magic. Witches, shifters, and fae don't exist, right? </p> <p>This new world I've discovered is dangerous. The Tainted want to kill me, innocent paranormals want my help, and the son of Hades needs me to find demons.</p> <p>Give me an Ibuprofen, and watch out. I'm not about to stand by and let someone else ruin my life. I'm a middle-aged woman on a brand-new mission, and nothing's going to stop me.</p>";
