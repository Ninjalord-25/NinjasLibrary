It is run by a tyrant known as The Jolly Mayor and his devious right hand, the last archmage in the world.

But when their decadence reaches new heights and begins to destroy the environment, the people stage an uprising to stop them. </p> <p>In four interrelated parts, <i>The Tangled Lands</i> is an evocative and epic story of resistance and heroic sacrifice in the twisted remains surrounding the last great city of Khaim. Paolo Bacigalupi and Tobias Buckell have created a fantasy for our times about a decadent and rotting empire facing environmental collapse from within - and yet hope emerges from unlikely places with women warriors and alchemical solutions. </p>";
