He has no idea who killed him or why.&nbsp;</p> <p>But he’s damn sure going to find out.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a smartass severed head as a partner, Jones hangs up his shingle in the city’s undead quarter. When he’s not solving cases (poorly), Jones is always looking to keep his flask full.&nbsp;</p> <p>Prohibition is in full swing, and the dead need alcohol to function. Without liquor they become mindless, flesh-munching ghouls. (In a word: braineaters.)&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything will probably be fine. The investigation into his own murder probably won’t point Jones toward the city’s most important bootlegger.&nbsp;</p> <p>And even if it does, it’s not like he’ll risk cutting off the hooch just to seek justice for himself, right? No one man’s life is worth unleashing a cannibalistic orgy of violence. Right?&nbsp;</p> <p>Cracking this case will be a tall order, but one thing’s for sure: Whatever happens, Braineater Jones isn’t getting out of this one alive....</p>";
