window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now an Amazon Original series</b></p> <p><b>Winner of the Hugo Award</b></p> <p><b>\"The single most resonant and carefully imagined book of Dick's career.\" --</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b></p> <p>It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the <i>I Ching </i>is as common as the <i>Yellow Pages.</i> All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war - and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan.</p> <p>This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it, Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.</p>";
