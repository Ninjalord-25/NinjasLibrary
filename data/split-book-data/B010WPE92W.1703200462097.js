window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What are you waiting for? NA paranormal fantasy at its best by international best-selling author Tara Brown. </p><p>Someone is drugging the fairest of them all and hurting them in the dark corners of the forests around Port Mackenzie - shrouding the town in mystery and darkness. But nothing is as it seems. In the dark corners of the small town, there is also a light, a cure to what ails the sick. But everything comes at a cost, a price that must be paid. Aimee James discovers that cost the moment she dies. She discovers there are worse things than dying. She finds herself cursed. Discover how the Devil's Roses all starts because in the end it is the beginning that chooses who we will become and what side we will take. </p><p>Note from the author - This is the newly edited version. It won't ever be perfect because this is where I started; this was my first book. I don't even recognize the style of writing anymore, I have changed so much. So it is nice for me to be able to look at this and see where I started, how much I have grown as an author. We have gotten it as close to perfect as we can without ruining the experience of a debut novel by me, Tara Brown. Hope you enjoy, and thank you so much for listening to my beginning. </p>";
