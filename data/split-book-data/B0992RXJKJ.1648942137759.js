And only one man can end their reign of terror....</i></b></p> <p>For Vincent Donnelly, waking up in a field in the middle of nowhere was just the beginning. Frantic and terrified, he has no idea who he is, or how he got there. Nor does he know the five dead bodies lying next to him. All he knows for sure is that he hears whispering in his head. Voices that are not his own....</p> <p>With no memories or friends to rely on, Vincent finds himself drawn to the town of Alder Falls. Somehow, he is certain this place is connected to his hazy past. But the local townsfolk urge him to leave before nightfall. For when the sun sets, the dead walk these shadowy streets and prey upon the living.</p> <p>A chance encounter in town reveals that the voices in Vincent's head are the memories of lost souls, trapped within his shattered mind, including a powerful necromancer, who has amassed the army of corpses plaguing the town. To solve the mystery of his past, Vincent must exorcise this sinister enemy from the confines of his mortal shell.</p> <p>But setting such an evil presence free could unleash an even deadlier power. A being of pure darkness, who hungers for Vincent’s soul....</p>";
