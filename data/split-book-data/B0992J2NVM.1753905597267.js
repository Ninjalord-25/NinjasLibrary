And the only protection he’ll need will be a stake and a cross.</p> <p>And Sebastian’s not the only one coming tonight. A detachment of special forces vampire killers led by the merciless Colonel Bingham has tracked the Coven to this remote location, although they’ve bitten off more than they can chew this time. </p> <p>Bingham expected to find one vampire, not eight.
