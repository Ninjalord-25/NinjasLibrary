But at the end of the day, the number in his bank account went up.</p> <p>That man got a second chance at life. He woke up in another world, one full of adventures and romances and monsters and gods. And floating above his head, he saw the number \"1\".</p> <p>So what did he say?</p> <p>\"Gosh, I better make the number go up.\"</p> <p>Not today. Not for this old soul. Reborn as a beast of battle meant to live a short life and die screaming, Garek refuses. He puts the madness of skills and levels behind him and sets out to found a little farmstead. He grows crops. Maybe someday he'll get a pig and have bacon.</p> <p>It's a shame the world won't let him be. It's a shame that the warmongers and level-grinders hate nothing more than a soul at peace.</p> <p>He put down his sword for a plowshare, but when trouble comes calling, he'll pick it up again.</p>";
