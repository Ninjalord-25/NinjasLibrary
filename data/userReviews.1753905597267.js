I got the book for doing a review of it. while it started out kind of slow there were a few stoires that gripped me in there and a few I didnt. Around about 3 to 4 hours into the book some of the stories really got good. The books namesake, Nightmare Flower, was particularly unsettling in a delightful way. the Narrator, while using mostly her voice for the good majority of the stories, had moments where she pulled me in and got me to see what was going on in the story as if I was there. especially with the last two stories. overall this was a pleasant read, not something I might go back and listen to often. but if you like a mix of horrifying, melancholy, and sometimes bittersweet stories it is worth a listen </p>","title":"Book Review"}];
